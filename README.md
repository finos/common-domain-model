# Common Domain Model (CDM)

<img src=".github/bulb.svg" width="30"> [<kbd> <br> View CDM Homepage <br> </kbd>](https://cdm.finos.org/)

The Common Domain Model is an open standard project hosted under FINOS, the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Standards-Projects), starting in February 2023.   \
 \
The standard is developed through the [Community Specification](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#open-standard-projects) open governance process, and underlying code assets are released under the [Community Specification License 1.0](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/4._License.md). For versions before 4.0.0 and other license details, check [Notice.md](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/blob/master/NOTICE.md).

To participate in the standard process and working group meetings, [enroll as a participant](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/Getting%20Started.md#best-practices) by completing a [Community Specification Contributor License Agreement](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Standards-Projects#ip-licensing-requirements) (CSL CLA).  All meetings are to be held [in accordance with the FINOS policies and procedures](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/meeting-procedures).

For a general overview of the Common Domain Model, a comparative analysis with FpML, an exploration of the CDM's historical development and events, as well as insights into its further applications, including its role in the ecosystem and support for smart contract technology, we recommend reviewing the [CDM Overview deck](/pdfs/DM-Overview-Nov.pdf).
