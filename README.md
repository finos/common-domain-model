# CDM - Common Domain Model

## What is the CDM

The Common Domain Model (CDM) is a standardised, machine-readable and machine-executable blueprint for how financial products are traded and managed across the transaction lifecycle. It is represented as a `domain model`_ and distributed in open source.

## Purpose

A single, digital processing standard for trade events and actions enhances financial markets' operational efficiency in several ways:

* **Enables inter-operability and straight-through processing** across firms, solutions and platforms, reducing the need for reconciliation caused by variations in how each firm records trade lifecycle events.
* **Accelerates financial technology innovation** by providing a common, readily operational foundation for how technologies like distributed ledger, smart contracts, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence can be applied to financial markets.
* **Delivers better regulatory oversight**, promotes transparency and alignment between regulators and market participants and enables consistency in regulatory reporting, by providing a standard representation of trade data and supporting machine executable reporting requirements.

## Design Principles

To support these objectives, the CDM is built according to a set of design principles that include the following concepts:

* **Normalisation** through abstraction of common components
* **Composability** where objects are composed and qualified from the bottom up
* **Mapping** to existing industry messaging formats
* **Embedded logic** to represent industry processes
* **Modularisation** into logical layers

These design principles are further detailed in the :ref:`design-principles` section of the CDM documentation.

## Governance

The CDM [governance framework](https://cdm.docs.rosetta-technology.io/source/contribution.html#governance) regulates the development of the CDM in open source.

## Scope

The product scope of the CDM includes OTC derivatives, cash securities, securities financing, and commodities.

## CDM Components


**The CDM is made of three sets of components**, as laid-out in the CDM components diagram below:

* The ISDA CDM Distribution (in *blue*)
* The Rosetta DSL (in *grey*)
* CDM Applications (in *green*)

## ISDA CDM Distribution

The ISDA CDM distribution is openly accessible to all industry participants, subject to the ISDA CDM open source licence. This distribution is fully downloadable.

## Installation

OS X, Linux and Windows:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Usage example

A few motivating and useful examples of how your project can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially screenshots / videos ([LiceCap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is great for this kind of thing).

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```

## Contributing


### Contribution via Rosetta

The [Rosetta Design](https://rosetta-technology.io/design) application can be used to contribute to the CDM without setting up any development environment. Rosetta Designâ€™s [source control integration](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/1-workspace/#source-control-integration) means that a PR is automatically created to a fork of the FINOS CDM under the [Rosetta Models](https://github.com/rosetta-models) GitHub Organisation.

Steps:
  1. Create a Workspace for the CDM in Rosetta Design
  2. Review change in Rosetta Design
  3. Contribute change in Rosetta Design which will create PR in the rosetta-models organisation
  4. Create a PR to the Finos Github. See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
