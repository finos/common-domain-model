# The Use of *Agreements* in Financial Markets

## Introduction

Financial transactions consist primarily of agreements between parties
to make future payments or deliveries to each other. To ensure
performance, those agreements typically take the form of legally
enforceable contracts, which the parties record in writing to minimize
potential future disagreements.

It is common practice in some markets for different aspects of these
agreements to be recorded in different documents, most commonly dividing
those terms that exist at the trading relationship level (e.g. credit
risk monitoring and collateral) from those at the transaction level (the
economic and risk terms of individual transactions). Relationship
agreements and individual transaction level documents are often called
"master agreements" and "confirmations" respectively, and multiple
confirmations may be linked to a single master agreement.

Both the relationship and transaction level documents may be further
divided into those parts that are standard for the relevant market,
which may exist in a pre-defined base form published by a trade
association or similar body, and those that are more bespoke and agreed
by the specific parties. The standard published forms may anticipate
that the parties will choose from pre-defined elections in a published
form, or create their own bespoke amendments.

The ISDA Master Agreement is an internationally recognised document
which is used to provide certain legal and credit protection for parties
who enter into OTC derivatives. Similarly, the ISLA Global Master Securities 
Lending Agreement (GMSLA) is the market standard documentation used for 
parties entering into securities lending agreements. Parties that execute 
agreements are expected to have bi-lateral Master Agreements with each
other that cover an agreed range of transactions. Accordingly in the CDM
each transaction can be associated with a single master agreement, and a
single master agreement can be associated with multiple transactions.

For OTC derivatives there are sets of credit support documentation which parties 
may enter into as part of Master Agreement to contain the terms on which they 
will exchange collateral. Collateral provides protection to a party against the
risk that its counterparty defaults and fails to pay the amount that it
owes on default. The risk of loss in this scenario is for the current
cost of replacing the defaulted transactions (for which margin is called
"variation margin") and the risk of further loss before the default can
be closed out (called "initial margin" or "independent amount").

There are several different types of ISDA credit support document,
reflecting variation and initial margin, regulatory requirements and
terms for legal relationships under different legal jurisdictions. The
key components of the suite of credit support documents are summarized
below:

-   **Credit Support Annexes (CSAs)** exist in New York, English, Irish,
    French, and Japanese law forms. They define the terms for the
    provision of collateral by the parties in derivatives transactions,
    and in some cases they are specialized for initial margin or
    variation margin.
-   **Credit Support Deed CSD (CSD)** is very similar to a CSA, except
    that it is used to create specific types of legal rights over the
    collateral under English and Irish law, which requires a specific
    type of legal agreement (a deed).
-   **The Collateral Transfer Agreement and Security Agreement (CTA and
    SA)** together define a collateral arrangement where initial margin
    is posted to a custodian account for use in complying with initial
    margin requirements. The CTA/SA offers additional flexibility by
    allowing parties to apply one governing law to the mechanical
    aspects of the collateral relationship (the CTA) and a different
    governing law to the grant and enforcement of security over the
    custodian account (the SA).

---
**Note:**
For users of the ISLA GMSLA the details of the collateral schedule are 
included as an annex to the document itself.

---

In the CDM and in this user documentation, *legal agreement* refers to
the written terms of a relationship-level agreement, and *contract*
refers to the written terms defining an executed financial transaction.

## Legal Agreements in the CDM

The CDM provides a digital representation of the legal agreements that
govern transactions and workflows. The benefits of this digital
representation are summarized below:

-   **Supporting marketplace initiatives to streamline and standardise
    legal agreements** with a comprehensive digital representation of
    such agreements.
-   **Providing a comprehensive representation of the financial
    workflows** by complementing the trade and lifecycle event model and
    formally tying legal data to the business outcome and performance of
    legal clauses. (e.g. in collateral management where lifecycle
    processes require reference to parameters found in the associated
    legal agreements, such as a Credit Support Annex).
-   **Supporting the direct implementation of functional processes** by
    providing a normalised representation of legal agreements as
    structured data, as opposed to the unstructured data contained of a
    full legal text that needs to be interpreted first before any
    implementation (e.g. for a calculation of an amount specified in a
    legal definition).

The scope of the CDM legal agreement model includes a generic Master Agreement 
Schedule representation, as well as all of the types of ISDA credit support 
documents. The legal agreement model is explained below, including examples and 
references to these types of documents.

The topics covered in this section are listed below:

-   Modelling Approach
-   Legal Agreement Data Structure
-   Linking Legal Agreements to contracts

## Modelling Approach

### Scope

The legal agreement model in the CDM comprises the following features:

-   **Composable and normalised model representation** of legal 
    agreements. The terms of an agreement can be defined by
    identification of the published base document, and the elections or
    amendments made to that base in a specific legal agreement. There
    are distinct versions of the published agreements for jurisdiction
    and year of publication, but the set of elections and amendments to
    those base agreements often belong to a common universe. Therefore,
    the CDM defines each of these terms in a single location, and allows
    for the representation of a specific legal agreement by combining
    terms where appropriate. The following legal agreements are
    supported in the CDM:
	
	**Master Agreement Schedule**

    -   Master Agreement Schedule supporting the representation of industry 
	    standard or bespoke documentation (e.g. ISDA Master 2002, ISLA GMSLA
        2010)

    **Initial Margin Agreements**

    -   ISDA 2016 Phase One Credit Support Annex ("CSA") (Security
        Interest -- New York Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 Phase One Credit Support Deed ("CSD") (Security
        Interest -- English Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 Phase One CSA (Loan -- Japanese Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 ISDA-Clearstream Collateral Transfer Agreement ("CTA")
        (New York law and Multi Regime English Law) and Security
        Agreement
    -   ISDA 2016 ISDA-Euroclear CTA (New York law and Multi Regime
        English Law) and Security Agreement
    -   ISDA 2018 CSA (Security Interest -- New York Law)
    -   ISDA 2018 CSD (Security Interest -- English Law)
    -   ISDA 2019 Bank Custodian CTA and Security Agreement (English
        Law, New York Law)
    -   ISDA 2019 ISDA-Clearstream CTA and Security Agreement
        (Luxembourg Law -- Security-provider or Security-taker name)
    -   ISDA 2019 ISDA-Euroclear CTA and Security Agreement

    **Variation Margin Agreements**

    -   ISDA 2016 CSA for Variation Margin ("VM") (Security Interest -
        New York Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 CSA for VM (Title Transfer -- English Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 CSA for VM (Loan -- Japanese Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 CSA for VM (Title Transfer -- Irish Law)
    -   ISDA 2016 CSA for VM (Title Transfer -- French Law)

-   **Composable and normalised model representation** of the eligible
    collateral schedule for initial and variation margin into a directly
    machine readable format.

-   **Linking of legal agreement into a trade object** through the CDM
    referencing mechanism.

-   **Mapping to ISDA Create derivative documentation negotiation
    platform** : Synonyms identified as belonging to `ISDA_Create_1_0`
    have been defined to establish mappings that support automated
    transformation of ISDA Create documents into objects that are
    compliant with the CDM.

    -   The mapping between the two models through the use of Synonyms
        validated that all the necessary permutations of elections and
        data associated with the supported agreements have been
        replicated in the CDM
    -   Ingestion of JSON sample files generated from ISDA Create for
        samples of executed documents has been implemented to demonstrate this 
		capability between ISDA Create and the CDM.
    -   More details on Synonyms are provided in the Mapping (Synonym)
        section of this document.

---
**Note:**
The CDM supports the ISDA CSA for Variation Margin, but this document is
not yet represented in ISDA Create - the CDM representation of this
document is tested with alternative external sample data.

### Design Principles

The key modelling principles that have been adopted to represent legal
agreements are described below:

-   **Distinction between the agreement identification features and the
    agreement content features**
    -   The agreement identification features: agreement name, publisher
        (of the base agreement being used), identification, etc. are
        represented by the `LegalAgreementBase` type.
    -   The agreement content features: elections and amendments to the
        published agreement, related agreements and umbrella agreement
        terms are represented by the `AgreementTerms`.
-   **Composite and extendable model**.
    -   The Legal Agreement model follows the CDM design principles of
        composability and reusability to develop an extendable model
        that can support multiple document types.
    -   For instance, the `LegalAgreementBase` data type uses components
        that are also used as part of the CDM trade and lifecycle event
        components: e.g. `Party`, `Identifier`, `date`.
-   **Normalisation of the data representation**
    -   Strong data type attributes such as numbers, Boolean, or
        enumerations are used where possible to create a series of
        normalised elections within terms used in legal documentation and
        create a data representation of the legal agreement that is
        machine readable and executable. This approach allows CDM users
        to define normalised elections into a corresponding legal
        agreement template to support functional processes.
    -   In practice the use of elections expressed in a `string` format
        has been restricted, as the `string` format is generally
        unsuitable for the support of standardised functional processes.

The components of the legal agreement model specified in the CDM are
detailed in the section below.

## Legal Agreement Data Structure

The `LegalAgreement` data type represents the highest-level data type
for defining a legal agreement in the CDM. This data type extends the
`LegalAgreementBase`, which contains information to uniquely identify an
agreement. There are three non-inherited components to `LegalAgreement`,
as shown in the code snippet below:.

``` Haskell
type LegalAgreement extends LegalAgreementBase:
  [metadata key]
   [rootType]
  agreementTerms AgreementTerms (0..1)
  relatedAgreements LegalAgreement (0..*)
  umbrellaAgreement UmbrellaAgreement (0..1)
```

The `LegalAgreementBase`, `UmbrellaAgreement`, and `AgreementTerms` are
defined in the following sections.

### Agreement Identification

The CDM provides support for implementors to uniquely identify a legal
agreement solely through the specification of the agreement
identification features, as represented in the `LegalAgreementBase`
abstract data type, which is illustrated below:

``` Haskell
type LegalAgreementBase:
  agreementDate date (0..1)
  effectiveDate date (0..1)
  identifier Identifier (0..*)
  legalAgreementIdentification LegalAgreementIdentification (1..1)
  contractualParty Party (2..2)
   [metadata reference]
  otherParty PartyRole (0..*)
```

As indicated by the cardinality for the attributes in this data type,
all legal agreements must contain an agreement date, two contractual
parties, and information indicating the published form of market
standard agreement being used (including the name and publisher of the
legal agreement being specified in the `agreementIdentification`
attribute). Provision is made for further information to be captured,
for example an agreement identifier, which is an optional attribute.

### Related Agreement

Related agreements attribute is used to specify any higher-level
agreement(s) that may govern the agreement, either as a reference to
such agreements when specified as part of the CDM, or through
identification of some of the key terms of those agreements.

---
**Note:**
The `LegalAgreementType` attribute is used to map related agreement
terms that are embedded as part of a transaction message converted from
another model structure, such as FpML. For example, this attribute may
reference an ISDA Master Agreement, which is not modelled or mapped in
the CDM `LegalAgreement` data type.

---

### Umbrella Agreement

`UmbrellaAgreement` is a data type used to specify the applicability of
Umbrella Agreement terms, relevant specific language, and underlying
entities associated with the umbrella agreement.

The below snippet represents the `UmbrellaAgreement` data type.

``` Haskell
type UmbrellaAgreement:
  isApplicable boolean (1..1)
  language string (0..1)
  parties UmbrellaAgreementEntity (0..*)
```

### Agreement Content

`AgreementTerms` is used to specify the content of a legal agreement in
the CDM. There are two components to agreement terms, as shown in the
code snippet below:

``` Haskell
type AgreementTerms:
  agreement Agreement (1..1)
  clauseLibrary boolean (0..1)
  counterparty Counterparty (2..2)
```

The following sections describe each of these components.

### Agreement

`Agreement` is a data type used to specify the individual elections
contained within the legal agreement. It contains a set of encapsulated
data types, each containing the elections used to define a specific
group of agreements.

``` Haskell
type Agreement:
  creditSupportAgreementElections CreditSupportAgreementElections (0..1)
  collateralTransferAgreementElections CollateralTransferAgreementElections (0..1)
  securityAgreementElections SecurityAgreementElections (0..1)
  masterAgreementSchedule MasterAgreementSchedule (0..1)
  transactionAdditionalTerms TransactionAdditionalTerms (0..1)
  condition: one-of
```

### Counterparty

Each counterparty to the agreement is assigned an enumerated value of
either `Party1` or `Party2` through the association of a
`CounterpartyRoleEnum` with the corresponding `Party`. The
`CounterpartyRoleEnum` value is then used to specify elections
throughout the rest of the document.

``` Haskell
enum CounterpartyRoleEnum:
  Party1
  Party2
```

``` Haskell
type Counterparty:
  role CounterpartyRoleEnum (1..1)
  partyReference Party (1..1)
   [metadata reference]
```

The modelling approach for elective provisions and the master agreement schedule
are explained in further detail in the corresponding sections below.

## Election Provisions

Election provisions are the detailed terms of agreement for specific legal
documents. 

In many cases the pre-printed clauses in legal agreement templates offer 
pre-defined elections that the parties can select. In these cases, the clauses 
are explicitly identified in the agreement templates, including the potential 
values for each election (e.g. an election from a list of options or a specific 
type of information such as an amount, date or city). 

Due to the domain and document specific nature of election provisions, the
clauses and applicable values are currently not included in the CDM. However, 
there are extensions to the CDM available that can provide declarative types for
specific documents.

For example, the ISDA Foundations model - which is available to all ISDA members
upon request - can be used to represent the ISDA Credit Support Annexes. To gain
access to ISDA Foundations please send an email to: <cdminfo@isda.org>

## Master Agreement Schedule

Legal documentation is required to describe the contract between parties on 
every transaction. The structures under the `MasterAgreementSchedule` have been
created to be domain agnostic, and generic enough to describe any industry 
standard or bespoke master agreement. 

The types and datapoints that have been defined are loosely based upon the use 
of a Clause Library. A Clause Library extracts the business outcomes from a 
legal document and allows them to be expressed without having to include the 
actual legal text or terminology from the agreement within the CDM itself.  

The CDM supports the representation of legal agreement clauses with their 
associated election criteria. These additional criteria include clause variants 
and any variables that are required to define the elections agreed upon for that
clause.

The model uses clause and variant identifiers to reference textual data that is 
held outside of the model itself. The identifiers themselves can be defined by 
the publisher of a legal document.

### Clause

The `MasterAgreementSchedule` is where the details of the master agreement are 
defined. This is made up of a list of the clauses that make up that agreement. 
Each clause must have at least one variant associated to it.

``` Haskell
type MasterAgreementSchedule:
	clause MasterAgreementClause (1..*)
```

The `clause` allows a list of clauses to be represented, with each element in 
the list representing a single clause in the agreement. Each clause has the 
following data that can be defined for it.

``` Haskell
type MasterAgreementClause:
	identifer MasterAgreementClauseIdentifierEnum (1..1)
    name string (0..1)
    counterparty CounterpartyRoleEnum (0..2) 
    otherParty PartyRoleEnum (0..*) 
    variant MasterAgreementClauseVariant (1..*)
```

---
**Note:**
Currently the clause identifers are presented as an enumerated list. This is to
give the publisher of a master agreement a level of control over the clause
defintion in the model. A more flexible approach to how clauses can be identifed
will be introduced in a future enhancement to this area.

---

### Variant

The `variant` type is held under a `clause` and contains the elections defined 
for the variant that has been selected for this clause. Note that it is also 
possible that a clause can reference multiple variants.

``` Haskell
type MasterAgreementClauseVariant: 
    identifier MasterAgreementVariantIdentifierEnum (1..1) 
    name string (0..1) 
    counterparty CounterpartyRoleEnum (0..2) 
    otherParty PartyRoleEnum (0..*) 
    variableSet MasterAgreementVariableSet (0..*)
```

---
**Note:**
Variant identifiers are presented using an enumerated list, in the same way that 
clause identifers are defined. This allows the publisher of a document to 
associate variants to a clause. This approach will also be revisited in a future
enhancement.

---

### Variables

Variables are additional data required to define the criteria of an election. 
These can be defined in the `variableSet` element of a `variant`.

Variables are presented as a `name`/`value` pair, where the name of the variable
and its value can be set. Note that variable names should match the names as 
defined in the agreement documentation or Clause Library that represents that 
agreement.

``` Haskell
type MasterAgreementVariableSet: 
    variableSet MasterAgreementVariableSet (0..*) 
    name string (0..1) 
    value string (0..1) 
```

The `MasterAgreementVariableSet` also includes a reference to itself. This 
allows tables of values rather than just single values to be entered for a 
clause variant. To prevent anything deeper than a table of data to be 
represented (i.e. columns and rows) a condition has been added to only allow two
levels of nesting.
