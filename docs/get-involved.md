## Interact with the CDM community
 
**GitHub**

CDM activity primarily happens in this [CDM GitHub repository](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model). [Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) the repository in order to be notified of new Pull Requests and issues.
 
**Email**

If you'd like to receive official updates, please send an email to help@finos.org. You can join the CDM mailing list by sending an email to [cdm+subscribe@lists.finos.org](mailto:cdm+subscribe@lists.finos.org). 
 
**Meetings**

Finally, another great way to interact with the community is to attend the bi-weekly CDM Contribution Review Working Group, monthly Collateral Working Group, monthly FINOS CDM Structured Products Working Group, monthly Steering Technology Architecture Working Group, and/or quarterly FINOS CDM Steering Working Group: email help@finos.org to be added to the meeting invites directly, or find the meeting in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com). 

**Need help?**

Email help@finos.org. if you need help getting started in the CDM Community or if you encounter technical difficulties accessing repositories, mailing lists or meetings.
