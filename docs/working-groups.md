## Working Groups

Click [here](cdm-org-structure.md) to view the CDM organisational structure and the Working Groups' scope.

**Any Participant may propose a Working Group.** Proposals for the formation of a new Working Group are made by contacting the [CDM Steering Working Group](CDM-Steering-WG.md) Chair, clearly stating the objectives, deliverables and committed maintainers/editors for the proposed Working Group.

**Approval of Specification Changes by Working Groups.** Participants of each Working Group approve the “proposed” changes from that working group; the “approved changes” within a given Working Group will be brought to the Steering Working Group as a proposed “Pre-Draft” contribution.
