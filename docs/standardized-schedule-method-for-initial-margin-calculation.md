# Standardized Schedule Method for Initial Margin Calculation
## Background
The 2007 financial crisis exposed **critical vulnerabilities** within the banking sector and financial markets. **Key issues** included insufficient capital reserves, lack of transparency in derivatives trading, and inadequate risk management practices, leading to widespread economic turmoil and significant financial losses for institutions and investors.

In response, the **G20 mandated reforms** aimed at **increasing transparency** and **reducing risks** in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. This global effort sought to create a more **stable financial environment**, minimizing the chances of future crises.
- **Exchange Trading**: Transitioning OTC derivatives to regulated exchanges helps improve transparency by making market activities visible to regulators and participants.
- **Central Clearing**: Central counterparties (CCPs) manage counterparty risk by becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, thereby enhancing market integrity and reducing the risk of defaults.
- **Reporting Requirements**: Mandated reporting of all trades to trade repositories allows regulators to monitor market activities, assess risks, and implement necessary interventions.
- **Higher Capital Requirements**: Stricter capital requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives were established to ensure financial institutions maintain adequate buffers against potential losses.

To address systemic risks, the **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision** (BCBS) and the **International Organization of Securities Commissions** (IOSCO) introduced **margin requirements** mandating collateral exchanges. Two main methods were developed for calculating intial margin (IM): **Standard Initial Margin Model** (SIMM) and the **Standardized Schedule**.

The **Standard Initial Model** (SIMM), developed by ISDA, offers a risk-sensitive, standardized IM calculation reflecting netting and diversification benefits, making it suitable larger institutions with complex portfolios. In contrast, the **Standardized Schedule** provides a simpler, conservative calculation method facilitating compliance for smaller firms or those without advanced modeling capabilities. Both approaches helps institutions meet BCBS-IOSCO guidelines, balancing regulatory compliance with effective risk management.

## Standardized Schedule Method

The **standardized schedule method** offers a simplified and **less risk-sensitive approach** to calculating Initial Margin (IM). It is particularly designed for market participants who may not possess the expertise or resources to develop and maintain sophisticated quantitative models.

By utilizing this method, market participants can ensure that margin calculations are straightforward and accessible. This is crucial for smaller firms or those entering the market, as it levels the playing field. This method provides a **conservative approach**, ensuring that initial margin calculations adequately cover potential exposures without overly complicating the process.

The **standardized schedule** is aligned with **regulatory requirements**, promoting adherence to **BCBS-IOSCO guidelines**. This alignment helps institutions avoid penalties and enhance their overall compliance posture.

## Key components of the Standardised Schedule

The standardized schedule defines specific **margin rates** for various asset classes, durations, and notional exposures. This provides a clear framework for determining the necessary initial margin amounts.

| Asset Class            | Margin Rate |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Credit: 0-2 year duration    | 2%          |
| Credit: 2-5 year duration    | 5%          |
| Credit: 5+ year duration    | 10%          |
| Commodity    | 15%          |
| Equity | 15%         |
| Foreign exchange     | 6%         |
| Interest rate: 0-2 year duration     | 1%         |
| Interest rate: 2-5 year duration     | 2%         |
| Interest rate: 5+ year duration     | 4%         |
| Other     | 15%         |

For example, credit derivatives generally have higher margin rates due to their increased default risk, while interest rate derivatives have lower rates due to their relatively stable nature.

Each asset class is assigned a predetermined margin rate based on its inherent risk characteristics, duration, and exposure levels. This differentiation ensures that margin requirements are proportional to the risks associated with each asset type.

## Standardized Initial Margin Formula

The formula for calculating net standardized initial margin is as follows:
     ```
     Net standardised IM = (0.4 x Gross IM) + (0.6 x NGR x Gross IM)
     ```
- **Gross IM**: Represents the total initial margin calculated by multiplying the notional amount of the derivative by its corresponding margin rate. This figure reflects the total potential exposure before any adjustments for netting.
- **NGR (Net-to-Gross Ratio)**: This ratio accounts for the benefits of netting and hedging within a portfolio. It reflects the relationship between net current replacement costs and gross current replacement costs, allowing for a more nuanced margin requirement that considers actual exposures.

This formula is critical as it allows for a comprehensive assessment of risk while ensuring that the margin requirements are neither excessive nor inadequate. It promotes a balanced approach to risk management, aligning with regulatory expectations.

## CDM Implementation Overview

The CDM Standardized Schedule implementation aims to accomplish the following:

- **Development of Standardized Margin Schedule Method**: Create a consistent approach for calculating initial margins across various financial products.
- **Enhancement of Accuracy and Efficiency**: Improve the precision of margin calculations to better reflect financial risks. Reduce time and resources needed for margin computations
- **Compliance with the regulatory standards**: Ensure adherence to evolving regulations regarding margin requirements in the OTC derivatives market.
- **Streamlining the margin calculation process**: Simplify the steps involved in calculating initial margins, making it easier for market participants to follow

These objectives will collectively enhance the effectiveness and reliability of margin calculations in the financial industry.

# Methodology for CDM Implementation

The methodology for implementing the standardized margin schedule in the CDM framework consists of three main steps:

1. **Identification of required inputs for calculation**: The first step involves **identifying and gathering all necessary data points** that will be used to compute the initial margin. This ensures that all relevant factors are considered in the calculation process.
2. **Extraction of trade information for initial margin calculation**: Dedicated functions are utilized to **extract relevant trade data**, ensuring that the calculations are based on accurate and up-to-date information.
3. **Calculation of initial margin amounts**: Finally, the standardized **formulas and methodologies are applied to determine the required initial margin** accurately, taking into account the specific characteristics of each trade.

This systematic approach promotes **clarity** and **accuracy** in margin calculations, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards while enhancing risk management practices.

## Identification of inputs

To compute the initial margin using the standardized schedule method, specific inputs need to be identified from each trade. The following inputs are crucial:

1. **Asset Class**: The category of the derivative (e.g., credit, equity, commodity) that influences the margin rate.
2. **Product Class**: A specific classification of the financial product, aligned with ISDA guidelines to ensure standardization.
3. **Notional Amount**: The total value of the derivative contract, representing the size of the exposure.
4. **Notional Currency**: The currency in which the notional amount is denominated, necessary for financial calculations.
5. **Duration (in years)**: The remaining time until the derivative contract matures, which impacts the risk profile and margin requirement.

Using the **concept of product class** helps ensure consistency in determining the notional amount and duration for each type of product. This standardization is vital for harmonizing calculations across different market participants and enhancing comparability.

## Extraction of Information

Function `BuildStandardizedSchedule ` is designed to **extract all relevant trade information** necessary for calculating the gross initial margin. It streamlines the process of gathering data from trades, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

``` Javascript
func BuildStandardizedSchedule:
    inputs: 
        trade Trade (1..1)
    output: standardizedSchedule StandardizedSchedule (1..1)
    alias assetClass:
        StandardizedScheduleAssetClass(trade)
    alias productClass:
        StandardizedScheduleProductClass(trade)
    set standardizedSchedule -> assetClass:
        assetClass
    set standardizedSchedule -> productClass:
        productClass
    set standardizedSchedule -> notional:
        StandardizedScheduleNotional(trade, assetClass, productClass)
    set standardizedSchedule -> notionalCurrency:
        StandardizedScheduleNotionalCurrency(trade, assetClass, productClass)
    set standardizedSchedule -> durationInYears:
        StandardizedScheduleDuration(trade, assetClass, productClass)
```

The function operates by extracting critical data points from the provided trade information. This includes identifying the asset class and product class, which determine the applicable margin rates. Additionally, the function collects the notional amount and currency, as well as the duration of the contract.

This information is then organized into a standardized schedule, ensuring consistency and clarity for subsequent calculations.

## Calculation of Initial Margin Amounts

The next step involves **determining the required margin rate** for the trade based on its asset class and duration using `GetStandardizedScheduleMarginRate` function:

``` Javascript
func GetStandardizedScheduleMarginRate:
    inputs: 
        assetClass StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum (1..1)
        durationInYears number (1..1)
    output: percentage number (1..1)
    set percentage:
        if assetClass = StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum -> InterestRates then (
            if durationInYears <= 2 then 1.0
            else if durationInYears > 2 and durationInYears <= 5 then 2.0
            else if durationInYears > 5 then 4.0
        )
        else if assetClass = StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum -> Credit then (
            if durationInYears <= 2 then 2.0
            else if durationInYears > 2 and durationInYears <= 5 then 5.0
            else if durationInYears > 5 then 10.0
        )
        else if assetClass = StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum -> ForeignExchange then 6.0
        else if assetClass = StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum -> Equity then 15.0
        else if assetClass = StandardizedScheduleAssetClassEnum -> Commodity then 15.0
```

This function assesses the asset class and duration to determine the appropriate margin rate, which is essential for calculating the gross initial margin. 

The function ensures that margin rates are assigned consistently and reflect the underlying risk of the asset classes.

## Gross Initial Margin Calculation

Function `GetGrossInitialMarginFromStandardizedSchedule` calculates the **gross initial margin** based on the **standardized schedule** and **extracted trade information**:

``` Javascript
func GetGrossInitialMarginFromStandardizedSchedule:
    inputs: 
        standardizedSchedule StandardizedSchedule (1..1)
    output: grossInitialMargin Money (0..1)
    alias initialMarginRequirement:
        GetStandardizedScheduleMarginRate(standardizedSchedule -> assetClass, standardizedSchedule -> durationInYears)
    set grossInitialMargin -> value:
        standardizedSchedule -> notional * initialMarginRequirement * 0.01
    set grossInitialMargin -> unit -> currency:
        standardizedSchedule -> notionalCurrency
    post-condition PositiveGrossInitialMargin: <"Ensure gross initial margin is greater than 0">
        grossInitialMargin -> value > 0
```
The function first determines the margin rate using the `GetStandardizedScheduleMarginRate` function. Once the margin rate is established, it multiplies this rate by the notional amount of the trade to calculate the gross initial margin.

Accurate gross initial margin calculations are vital for managing counterparty risk and ensuring that sufficient collateral is available to cover potential losses. This process helps maintain stability in financial markets.

## Transformation to Net Initial Margin

To refine the gross initial margin into a net initial margin, the `GetNetInitialMarginFromExposure` function is employed to account for actual exposures within the portfolio:

``` Javascript
func GetNetInitialMarginFromExposure:
    inputs:
        exposure Exposure (0..1)
    output:
        initialMargin StandardizedScheduleInitialMargin (0..1)
    alias tradePortfolio:
        exposure -> tradePortfolio
    alias positions:
        tradePortfolio -> positions
    alias tradeInitialMargin:
        positions extract
            StandardizedScheduleTradeInfo {
                assetClass: BuildStandardizedSchedule(item -> tradeReference -> trade) -> assetClass,
                productClass: BuildStandardizedSchedule(item -> tradeReference -> trade) -> productClass,
                grossInitialMargin : GetGrossInitialMarginFromStandardizedSchedule(BuildStandardizedSchedule(item -> tradeReference -> trade)),
                markToMarketValue : item -> tradeReference -> valuationHistory filter method = ValuationTypeEnum -> MarkToMarket then only-element then amount
            }
    alias totalGIM:
        tradeInitialMargin -> grossInitialMargin -> value sum
    alias netCurrentReplacementCost:
        tradeInitialMargin -> markToMarketValue -> value sum
    alias grossCurrentReplacementCost:
        tradeInitialMargin -> markToMarketValue filter item -> value > 0 then value sum
    alias netToGrossRatio:
        netCurrentReplacementCost / grossCurrentReplacementCost
    add initialMargin -> tradeInfo:
        tradeInitialMargin
    set initialMargin -> netInitialMargin -> value:
        0.4*totalGIM + 0.6*totalGIM*netToGrossRatio  
    set initialMargin -> netInitialMargin -> unit -> currency:
        tradeInitialMargin -> markToMarketValue -> unit -> currency distinct only-element
    post-condition NonNegativeNetInitialMargin: <"Ensure net initial margin is non-negative">
        initialMargin -> netInitialMargin -> value >= 0
    post-condition TotalGIMAddition: <"Ensure that only a single currency exists">
        tradeInitialMargin -> grossInitialMargin -> unit -> currency distinct count = 1
    post-condition NGRAddition: <"Ensure that only a single currency exists">
        tradeInitialMargin -> markToMarketValue -> unit -> currency distinct count = 1
```
This function checks for existing exposures within the portfolio, allowing for an adjusted representation of the initial margin requirement. By deducting existing exposures from the gross initial margin, it reflects a more accurate margin requirement tailored to the actual risk profile of the portfolio.

If no exposures are present, it sets the initial margin value to zero, indicating that no additional margin is required beyond the gross amount calculated earlier.
