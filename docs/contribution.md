# Governance

The Common Domain Model is an open standard project hosted under FINOS, the [Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Standards-Projects), starting in February 2023.

The standard is developed through the [Community Specification](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#open-standard-projects) open governance process, and underlying code assets are released under the [Community Specification License 1.0](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/4._License.md). For versions before 4.0.0 and other license details, check [Notice.md](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/blob/master/NOTICE.md).

For a more detailed overview of the existing Working Group and standard Participants, Editors and Maintainers, please see [Governance.md](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md). For more information on discussions and announcements subscribe to our mailing list using the following [link](mailto:cdm+subscribe@lists.finos.org).

Committee members or any user of CDM within the community can propose
amendments in accordance with the following process:

![](/img/CDM-Development-Process.png)

A proposal can be defined at a conceptual level or a logical level (i.e.
in code). In each case, the proposal must be developed in line with the
CDM [design-principles](/docs/cdm-overview#design-principles) and
[agile-development-approach](/docs/cdm-overview#agile-development-approach) and submitted
to FINOS staff and the Architecture & Review Committee for approval. In
some instances, the proposal may not be immediately approved but may be
assigned to an existing or new Working Group for the purpose of
reviewing, revising or extending the proposal.

Once approved, the amendment will be scheduled to be merged with the
CDM's main code branch by the CDM Maintainers.

### Roles
The CSL specifies [three different contribution roles](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md#1roles) for each specific Working Group:

* Maintainers - those who drive consensus within the working group
* Editors - those who codify ideas into a formal specification
* Participants - anyone who provides contributions to the project under a signed CSL CLA. A great way to sign the CLA is to open a Pull Request to add your name to the [Participants.md](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/participants.md) file. 

# Working Groups

**2.1.0 Any Participant may propose a Working Group.** Proposals for the formation of a new Working Group are made by completion of a new [new CDM Working Group](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model) template, clearly stating the objectives, deliverables and committed maintainers/editors for the proposed Working Group.

**2.1.1 Approval of Specification Changes by Working Groups.** Participants of each Working Group approve the “proposed” changes from that working group; the “approved changes” within a given Working Group will be brought to the Steering Working Group as a proposed “Pre-Draft” contribution.

* Participants of the CDM Steering Working Group approve DRAFT specification releases.
* Maintainers of the CDM Steering Working Group will approve merging of the proposed “Pre-Draft” changes (coming from other Working Groups or otherwise from community) into the repo.
  
**2.2.0 CDM Steering Working Group.** The CDM Steering Working Group will review and approve completed Working Group formation proposals per 2.1.0.

**2.2.1 CDM Steering Working Group Purpose:** The Steering Working Group is responsible for developing the technical and modelling guidelines, setting and revising the project’s strategic roadmap, and for vetting proposed changes. The CDM Steering Working Group may approve or establish additional working groups.

**2.2.2 Appointment of CDM Steering Working Group Maintainers:**

* At the launch of the project, up to two initial Maintainers will be nominated by ICMA, ISDA, and ISLA (collectively, the “trade associations”).
* Additional CDM Steering Group Maintainers may be proposed by Participants. Proposed maintainers will be approved via consensus of the Participants and with agreement of existing Maintainers, and should meet the following criteria:
    * Proven experience in data modelling and/or software development in financial markets.
    * In-depth understanding and proven track record of contribution to the CDM, as well as other data standards (such as ISO) and messaging protocols (such as FIX, FpML or Swift).
      
**2.2.3 CDM Steering Working Group Decision Making:** As outlined in [governance.md](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md#2decision-making), The CDM Steering Working Group will operate by consensus-based decision-making. Maintainers are responsible for determining and documenting when consensus has been reached. In the event a clear consensus is not reached, Maintainers may call for a simple majority vote of Participants to determine outcomes.

**2.2.4 CDM Steering Working Group Appointment of the Editor(s):** Editors will review and implement pull requests not expressed in code, test and release new functionalities, resolve bugs and implement approved improvements.

## CDM Design Principles

Contributions to the CDM have to comply with the following set of design principles that include the following concepts:

* **Normalisation** through abstraction of common components
* **Composability** where objects are composed and qualified from the bottom up
* **Mapping** to existing industry messaging formats
* **Embedded logic** to represent industry processes
* **Modularisation** into logical layers \

## CDM development guidelines 

The CDM Development Guidelines are defined by the Steering Working Group. The full set of CDM development guidelines can be found [here](https://cdm.docs.rosetta-technology.io/source/contribution.html).

## Version Management

The CDM is developed, built and released using standard software
source-control management. Each new released version is announced to
users via a *release note* that describes the change introduced by that
new version. The CDM release history is available in the [Release
Section](#) of the CDM documentation.

## Semantic Versioning

The CDM is released using the semantic versioning 2.0 system - See
[SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). At high-level, the
format of a version number is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. `1.23.456`),
where:

-   A MAJOR (`1`) version may introduce backward-incompatible changes
    and will be used as high level release name (e.g. "CDM Version
    1").
-   A MINOR (`23`) version may introduce new features but in a
    backward-compatible way, for example supporting a new type of event
    or function.
-   A PATCH (`456`) version is for backward-compatible bug fixes, for
    example fixing the logic of a condition.

In addition, pre-release versions of a major release will be denoted
with a DEV tag as follows:

-   MAJOR.0.0-DEV.x (e.g. `1.0.0-DEV.789`), where x gets incremented
    with each new pre-release version until it becomes the MAJOR.0.0
    release.

The minor, patch and pre-release numbers may sometimes increment by more
than one unit. This is because release candidates may be created but not
immediately released. Subsequently, a version associated with the next
incremental unit may be released that includes the changes from the
earlier release candidate.

Unless under exceptional circumstances, the major number will be
incremented by one unit only.

## Backward Compatibility

Like other types of software, *backward compatibility* in the context of
a domain model means that an implementor of that model would not have to
make any change to update to such version.

-   Prohibited changes:
    -   Change to the structure (e.g. the attributes of a data type or
        the inputs of a function) or removal of any model element
    -   Change to the name of any model element (e.g. types, attributes,
        enums, functions or reporting rules)
    -   Change to any condition or cardinality constraint that makes
        validation more restrictive
    -   Change to the DSL that results in any existing expression
        becoming invalid
    -   Change to the DSL that results in change to any of the generated
        code's public interfaces
-   Allowed changes:
    -   Change that relaxes any condition or cardinality constraint
    -   Change to any synonym that improves, or at least does not
        degrade, the mapping coverage
    -   Addition of new examples or test packs
    -   Change to the user documentation or model descriptions
    -   Addition of new data types, optional attributes, enumerations,
        rules or functions that do not impact current functionality

Exceptions to backward compatibility may be granted for emergency bug
fixes following decision from the relevant governance body.

## Version Availability

Several versions of the CDM will be made available concurrently, with a
dual objective.

-   The latest *development* version (i.e. with a pre-release tag)
    fosters continued, rapid change development and involves model
    contributions made by the industry community. Changes that break
    backward compatibility are allowed. This development version is
    available in read-only and read-write access on the CDM's
    modelling-platforms.
-   The latest *production* version (i.e. without any pre-release tag)
    offers a stable, well-supported production environment for consumers
    of the model. Unless under exceptional circumstances, no new
    disruptive feature shall be introduced, mostly bug fixes only. Any
    change shall adhere to a strict governance process as it must be
    backward-compatible. Generally, it can only be developed by a CDM
    Maintainer. This production version is available in read-only access
    through the CDM's modelling-platforms.
-   Earlier production versions, when still supported, are also
    available in read-only access for industry members who are still
    implementing older versions of the model. Over time, those earlier
    production versions enter *long-term support* in which
    supportability will be degraded, until they eventually become
    unsupported.

**Example**. Assume that the latest major release of the model is 5. The
various versions available would be as follows:

-   5.0.0 and any subsequent 5.x would be the latest production version.
    Backward-compatibility to the initial 5.0.0 version would be
    maintained for any 5.x successor version.
-   The latest 4.x and 3.x may also be supported, but 2.x could be under
    long-term support and 1.x unsupported altogether.
-   6.0.0-DEV.x would be the latest development version. It can, and
    will generally, contain changes that are not backward-compatible
    with version 5. Backward-compatibility between successive
    6.0.0-DEV.x versions is also not assured. Once fully developed,
    version 6.0.0 can be tagged as a major release and becomes the new
    latest production version.

**Note:**
The above example is for illustration only and not indicative of
actually supported CDM versions.

# Design Principles

The purpose of this section is to detail the CDM design principles that
any contribution to the CDM development must adhere to. The CDM supports
the market objectives of standardisation via a set of design principles
that include the following concepts:

-   **Normalisation** through abstraction of common components, e.g.
    *price* or *quantity*
-   **Composability** where objects are composed and qualified from the
    bottom up
-   **Mapping** to existing industry messaging formats, e.g. *FpML*
-   **Embedded logic** to represent industry processes, e.g. data
    validation or state-transition logic
-   **Modularisation** into logical layers, using *namespace*
    organisation

## Normalisation

**To achieve standardisation across products and asset classes, the CDM
identifies logical components that fulfil the same function** and
normalises them, even when those components may be named and treated
differently in the context of their respective markets. By helping to
remove inefficiencies that siloed IT environments can create (e.g.
different systems dealing with cash, listed, financing and derivative
trades make it harder to manage aggregated positions), such design
reaffirms the goal of creating an inter-operable ecosystem for the
processing of transactions across asset classes.

An example of this approach is the normalisation of the concepts of
*quantity*, *price* and *party* in the representation of financial
transactions. The CDM identifies that, regardless of the asset class or
product type, a financial transaction always involves two counterparties
*trading* (i.e. buying or selling) a certain financial product in a
specific quantity and at a specific price. Both quantity and price are
themselves a type of *measure*, i.e. an amount expressed in a specific
unit which could be a currency, a number of shares or barrels, etc. An
exchange rate between currencies, or an interest rate, also fit that
description and are represented as prices.

This approach means that a single logical concept such as *quantity*
represents concepts that may be named and captured differently across
markets: e.g. *notional* or *principal* amount etc. This in turn allows
to normalise processes that depend on this concept: for instance, how to
perform an allocation (essentially a split of the quantity of a
transaction into several sub-transactions) or an unwind, instead of
specialised IT systems handling it differently for each asset class.

**It is imperative that any request to add new model components or
extend existing ones is analysed against existing components** to find
patterns that should be factored into common components and avoid
specialising the model according to each use case. For instance, in the
model for *averaging* options (often used for commodity products,
whereby multiple price observations are averaged through time to be
compared to the option's strike price), the components are built and
named such that they can be re-used across asset classes.

## Composability

**To ensure re-usability across different markets, the CDM is designed
as a composable model** whereby financial objects can be constructed
bottom-up based on building-block components. A composable and modular
approach allows for a streamlined model to address a broad scope of
operational processes consistently across firms' front-to-back flows
and across asset classes. The main groups of composable components are:

-   **Financial products**: e.g. the same *option* component is re-used
    to describe option payouts across any asset class, rather than
    having specialised *Swaption*, *Equity Option* or *FX option* etc.
    components.
-   **Business events** that occur throughout the transaction lifecycle
    are described by composing more fundamental building blocks called
    *primitive events*: e.g. a *partial novation* is described by
    combining a *quantity change* primitive event (describing the
    partial unwind of the transaction being novated away) and a
    *contract formation* primitive event (describing the new contract
    with the novation party).
-   **Legal agreements** that document the legal obligations that
    parties enter into when transacting in financial products are
    constructed using *election* components associated to functional
    logic that is re-usable across different types of agreement: e.g.
    the same logic defining the calculation of margin requirements can
    be re-used across both initial and variation margin agreements.

In this paradigm, the type of object defined by the CDM, whether a
financial product, business event or legal agreement, is not declared
upfront: instead, the type is inferred through some business logic
applied onto its constituents, which may be context-specific based on a
given taxonomy (e.g. a product classification).

**The benefit of this approach is that consistency of object
classification is achieved through how those objects are populated**,
rather than depending on each market participant's implementation to
use the same naming convention. This approach also avoids the model
relying on specific taxonomies, labels or identifiers to function and
provides the flexibility to maintain multiple values from different
taxonomies and identifier sets as data in the model related to the same
transaction. This has a number of useful application, not least for
regulatory purposes.

## Mapping

**To facilitate adoption by market participants, the CDM is made
compatible with existing industry messaging formats.** This means that
the CDM does not need to be implemented "wholesale" as a replacement
to existing messaging systems or databases but can coexist alongside
existing systems, with a translation layer. In fact, the CDM is designed
to provide only a logical model but does not prescribe any physical data
format, neither for storage nor transport. This means that translation
to those physical data formats is built-in, and the CDM is best thought
of as a logical layer supporting inter-operability between them.

---
**Note:**
Although the CDM features a *serialisation* mechanism (currently in
JSON), this format is only provided for the convenience of representing
physical CDM objects and is not designed as a storage mechanism.

---

The need for such inter-operability is illustrated by a typical trade
flow, as it exists in derivatives: a trade may be executed using the
pre-trade FIX protocol (with an FpML payload representing the product),
confirmed electronically using FpML as the contract representation, and
reported to a Trade Repository under the ISO 20022 format. What the CDM
provides is a consistent logical layer that allows to articulate the
different components of that front-to-back flow.

In practice, mapping to existing formats is supported by *synonym*
mappings, which are a compact description in the CDM of how data
attributes in one format map to model components. In turn, those synonym
mappings can support an *ingestion* process that consumes physical data
messages and converts them into CDM objects.

**The CDM recognises certain formats as de-facto standards that are
widely used to exchange information between market participants.** Their
synonym mappings are included and rigorously tested in each CDM release,
allowing firms that already use such standards to bootstrap their CDM
implementation. Besides, because most standard messaging formats are
typically extended and customised by each market participants (e.g. FpML
or FIX), the CDM allows the synonym representation for those standards
to be similarly inherited and extended to cover each firm's specific
customisation.

## Embedded logic

**The CDM is designed to lay the foundation for the standardisation,
automation and inter-operability of industry processes**. Industry
processes represent events and actions that occur through the
transaction's lifecycle, from negotiating a legal agreement to
allocating a block-trade, calculating settlement amounts or exchanging
margin requirements.

While FINOS defines the protocols for industry processes in its
documentation library, differences in the implementation minutia may
cause operational friction between market participants. Even the
protocols that have a native digital representation have written
specifications which require further manual coding in order to result in
a complete executable solution: e.g. the validation rules in FpML, the
Recommended Practices/Guidelines in FIX or CRIF for SIMM and FRTB, which
are only available in the form of PDF documents.

Traditional implementation of a technical standard distributed in prose
comes with the risk of misinterpretation and error. The process is
duplicated across each firm adopting the standard, ultimately adding up
to high implementation costs across the industry.

**By contrast, the CDM provides a fully specified processing model that
translates the technical standards supporting industry processes** into
a machine-readable and machine-executable format. Systematically
providing the domain model as executable code vastly reduces
implementation effort and virtually eliminates the risk of
inconsistency. For instance, the CDM is designed to provide a fully
functional event model, where the state-transition logic for all
potential transaction lifecycle events is being specified and
distributed as executable code. Another CDM feature is that each model
component is associated with data validation constraints to ensure that
data is being validated at the point of creation, and this validation
logic is distributed alongside the model itself.

## Modularisation

**The set of files that define the CDM data structures and functions are
organised into a hierarchy of namespaces**. The first level in the
namespace hierarchy corresponds to the layer of the CDM that the
components belong to, and those CDM layers are organised from inner- to
outer-most as follows:

![](/img/namespaces.png)

Namespaces have many benefits:

-   Accelerated understanding of the model by allowing users to easily
    see a high-level view of the model and easily find, select, and
    study specific areas of interest
-   Faster and easier to find data types and functions for
    referencing/use in new components
-   Allowing for partial adoption of areas of interest in the model
-   Smaller upgrades representing new versions limited to the name
    spaces that are impacted

Each of these higher-level namespaces is further divided into
lower-level namespaces. The independent components in each namespace are
organised according to their core purpose but can be referenced from
anywhere in the model to allow all the components to work together for a
complete modelling solution. E.g. below is the *product* namespace:

![](/img/product-namespace.png)

**When developing new CDM components, the positioning of those
components in the namespace hierarchy is critical** as part of the
design (or potentially the re-organising of the hierarchy following the
new development), to ensure the CDM remains well organised.

## Agile Development Approach

The on-going development of the CDM adheres to a methodology inspired by
the *Agile* software development framework. This methodology is based on
two high-level principles:

1.  Focus on business value from the user's perspective, encapsulated
    in the concept of *user story*
2.  Delivery of small, releasable changes that contribute to that
    business value (sometimes referred to as *shippable increments*) -
    i.e. no "big bang" changes

Development by the CDM Maintainer team is being planned along a series
of 2-week *sprints* aligned onto the CDM Architecture and Review
Committee cycle. This development is guided by high-level priorities set
on a quarterly basis.

Outside [contributions](#how-to-contribute) that are proposed by
industry members, whilst not formally enlisted in the sprint process,
usually generate additional tasks (design, review, deployment etc.) for
the CDM Maintainer team that will need to be included in a sprint. Those
outside contributions still need to comply with the above development
principles to ensure a smooth integration with the rest of the
development by the CDM Maintainer team.

## Focus on business value

Any CDM development work must start from a business case describing the
business benefit being sought from the proposed development, as seen
from the perspective of the user who will enjoy that benefit. This is
know as a *user story* in the agile framework.

### What a user story looks like

A good user story comprises three elements which can be summarised into
one sentence: who, what and why.

-   *Who* defines the user (or more generally the set of users defined
    by some profiling) that will enjoy that benefit
-   *What* defines the feature to be delivered, as a verbal proposition
    applying to the user - i.e. "the user can do this or that"
-   *Why* specifies the benefit, i.e. what makes this feature important
    for the user

Since a story is from the user's perspective, it must be written in
plain language, or at least in language that is intelligible by that
user. It must be free of technical jargon that only the developer of
that feature may understand, so that it can be communicated to the user.

Further details about the business case (including documents, pictures,
sample data etc.) may be attached to a user story to complement that
summary, but the sumamry itself should be whole and self-explanatory.

### Story vs task

By contrast, how a story gets delivered is *not* part of that story:

-   *How* describes the set of *tasks* that will need to be executed to
    deliver the story. This is where the story is being decomposed into
    units of work written in terms that are actionable by the
    developers.

Tasks will typically map to steps in the software development lifecycle:
analysis, design, build, test, deploy. They must be planned before the
story is scheduled for development, as part of the *sprint planning*
process. Based on this planning, a set of stories is being prioritised
for development in the upcoming sprint. Those stories are communicated
to users at the Architecture and Review Committee, but not their
underlying tasks or techical details.

### Some examples

Instead of writing:

> "Commodity Swap Follow Up w/Enum values, mapping, samples"

Which is unclear, assumes some context which not all users may have
("follow-up" from what?) and has no explicit benefit, write:

> "A Commodity user of the CDM can map a set of basic Commodity
> attributes to represent simple Commodity derivative products."

In which some of the underlying tasks may be:

> -   "Map basic Commodity enumerations"
> -   "Add Commodity samples to the ingestion test pack"
> -   etc.

As a rule, a task is written in the imperative mode as an injunction to
the developer, whereas a story should be written as a sentence starting
with the user's profile as the subject of a verbal proposition. A story
written in the imperative mode is more likely a task and improperly
written.

For instance, instead of writing:

> "Release member contribution for DayCountFraction."

Write:

> "A user of interest rate products is able to model products that use
> the ACT/364 day count convention in the CDM."

Where the "Release" injunction is attached to a deploy-type task.

## Delivery of small releasable units

### What is a releasable unit

To maintain on-going momentum in the development of the CDM, delivery is
organised around small but releasable units of change. This means that
any change must be small enough to be achievable during a single sprint
(usually), but large enough to be releasable as a cohesive whole. In
particular, a change unit should not be regressive or break existing
functionality, even if only temporarily (except when retiring such
functionality is the purpose of that change) - in agile terms, it must
be *shippable*. This principle applies to on-going development by the
CDM Maintainers as well as to outside contributions.

**The CDM development approach aligns the concepts of user story and
releasable unit**, therefore stories should be calibrated to be
achievable during a single sprint.

> 1 contribution = 1 releasable unit = 1 user story

---
**Note:**
A CDM [release](#version-management) may contain more than 1 releasable
unit. Every unit should still be shippable in isolation, even if they
may end-up being shipped as a group.

---

### Epics

Some larger changes may not be achievable in a single sprint: e.g. if
they impact a large number of objects or core features of the model.
Such changes are known as *epics* and need to be decomposed into several
user stories. Developers or contributors are responsible for ensuring
that the changes are being delivered in small, incremental units and
must plan accordingly.

Particularly for complex stories, not all of that story's tasks may
necessarily be known in advance and therefore guaranteed to fit in one
single sprint. A story may demand some prior analysis before it can be
decomposed into development tasks. It may also require several design
iterations before development can start. Those prior discovery tasks
should be fit into a single sprint and the actual development scheduled
in a subsequent sprint.

The discovery phase may reveal that the story is not well calibrated and
is in fact an epic that should be further decomposed. This is an
acceptable scenario which does not contravene the prescribed development
approach, as long as development has not yet started. In that case the
story should be requalified and several stories be spun-out as a result,
before development can start.

# How to Contribute

The purpose of this section is to provide guidance for submitting,
reviewing and releasing changes to the CDM contributed by the wider
industry community including market participants, trade associations and
technology or service vendors. It describes:

-   What a Contributor should do to edit and contribute changes to the
    CDM
-   What a Maintainer should do to review the changes
-   How to release a new CDM version once changes have been approved

::: {#modelling-platforms}
Development of the CDM is supported through various modelling platforms,
including [Rosetta](https://rosetta-technology.io) and [Legend](https://legend.finos.org/studio). Regardless of the modelling
platform used, modelling and contribution to the CDM should go through
the contribution check-list below.

---

The steps required to change the CDM are aligned with the software
development lifecycle typically applicable to the development of any
other software. This development lifecycle is illustrated in the diagram
below. Each step is associated to the relevant component of the Rosetta
platform that can be used to support the development of the CDM.

![](/img/SDLC.png)

---
**Note:**
This documentation is not an endorsement of any modelling platform and
associated products and CDM users remain invited to leverage the tools
of their choosing. This contribution guide has been contextualised with
references to Rosetta to ease understanding and align with the current
process.

---

## Before you start modelling

Before you start modelling, please make sure you have gone through the
following pre-modelling checklist:

-   Review the [design-principles](/docs/cdm-overview#design-principles) and
    [governance](/docs/cdm-overview#governance)
-   Review the [Rosetta Starter Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/0-welcome-to-rosetta) or equivalent in your chosen
    modelling platform.

In addition, for large model changes or changes to core data types, it
is recommended that the Contributor reviews the
[agile-development-approach](/docs/cdm-overview#agile-development-approach) and follows
these steps:

-   **Define use case**. Identify and document one or more use cases
    with details (e.g. a sample trade).
-   **Draft conceptual design** (high level). Draft a conceptual view
    showing the set of data types, their definitions (and/or sample
    attributes but not the whole set of attributes), their relationships
    to each other, and, if applicable, a workflow.
-   **Design approval**. Obtain approval of high-level conceptual design
    from CDM stakeholders:
    -   CDM Owners (FINOS and other involved Trade Associations, where
        applicable)
    -   CDM Sub-Working Group, if applicable
    -   CDM Architecture and Review Committee
-   **Quality assurance**. Seek the early appointment of at least one
    CDM Maintainer who can assist modelling discussions and provide
    early feedback. CDM Maintainers are appointed by the CDM Owners as
    and when relevant. Please contact
    [cdm@lists.finos.org](mailto:cdm@lists.finos.org).

---
**Note:**
Unless explicitly instructed by a CDM Maintainer, a Contributor can only
ever develop changes to a development (i.e. pre-release) version of the
CDM.

---

## Editing the model

When editing the CDM, please go through the following modelling
checklist:

-   CDM version: use the latest available [development
    version](#version-availability)
-   Syntax: no syntax warnings or errors
-   Compilation: model compiles ok with no *static compilation* errors
-   Testing: all translate regression tests expectations for mapping,
    validation and qualification maintained or improved. Additional test
    samples may be needed if use-case is not covered by existing
    samples.
-   Namespace: all model components positioned in the correct namespace
-   Descriptions: all model components have descriptions

The following sections detail that checklist. When using the Rosetta
Design web application to edit the model, the Contributor should also
refer to the [Rosetta Design Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/0-welcome-to-rosetta).

### CDM version

To the extent possible it is recommended that the Contributor keeps
working with a version of the CDM that is as close as possible to the
latest to minimise the risk of backward compatibility.

Please refer to the [Source Control Integration Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/1-workspace/#source-control-integration) for more
information.

### Syntax

The model is represented in the Rosetta DSL syntax. All syntax warnings
and errors must be resolved to have a valid model before contributing
any changes. For further guidance about features of the syntax, please
refer to the [Rosetta DSL Documentation](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-dsl/rosetta-modelling-component).

In Rosetta Design, that syntax is automatically checked live as the user
edits the model, as described in the [Rosetta Design Content Assist
Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/2-rosetta-design/#rosetta-design-content-assist).

### Compilation

Normally, once the model is syntactically correctly edited, valid code
is being auto-generated and compiled. However, certain model changes can
cause compilation errors when changes conflict with static code (e.g.
certain mapper implementations).

The Rosetta support team can help resolve these errors before the
changes are contributed. In most cases you will be able to contact the
team via the [In-App chat](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/0-welcome-to-rosetta#in-app-chat). If the support team identifies that
significant work may be required to resolve these errors, they will
notify the Contributor who should then contact the CDM Maintainer
originally appointed for the proposed change and/or CDM Owners. The
latter will be able to assist in the resolution of the issues.

For more information about auto-compilation using the Rosetta DSL,
please refer to the [Rosetta Auto Compilation Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/2-rosetta-design/#auto-completion-scoping).

### Testing

The CDM has adopted a test-driven development approach that maps model
components to existing sample data (e.g., FpML documents or other
existing standards). Mappings are specified in the CDM using `synonym`
which are collected into a Translation Dictionary, and the sample data
are collected into a Test Pack. Each new model version is
regression-tested using those mappings to translate the sample data in
the Test Pack and then comparing against the expected number of mapped
data points, validation and qualification results.

When using Rosetta to edit the model, contributors are invited to test
their model changes live against the Test Pack using the Rosetta
Translate application, referring to the [Rosetta Translate Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/3-rosetta-translate/).
When editing existing model components, the corresponding synonyms
should be updated to maintain or improve existing mapping levels. When
adding new model components, new sample data and corresponding synonym
mappings should also be provided so the new use-case can be added to the
set of regression tests.

Please refer to the [Mapping Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-dsl/rosetta-modelling-component#mapping-component) for details about the synonym
mapping syntax.

### Namespace

All model components should be positioned appropriately in the existing
namespace hierarchy. If the proposed contribution includes changes to
the namespace hierarchy, those changes should be justified and
documented. Any new namespace should have an associated description, and
be imported where required.

Please refer to the [namespace-documentation](/docs/namespace) section for more details.

### Descriptions

All model components (e.g. types, attributes, conditions, functions
etc.) should be specified with descriptions in accordance with the [CDM
Documentation Style Guide](#documentation-style-guide).

## Contributing model changes

### Contribution checklist

Before you start contributing your model changes, please go through the
following contribution checklist:

-   Specify a meaningful title and description for the contribution
-   Notify the CDM Maintainers (via email or Slack) of the submitted
    contribution
-   Include:
    -   Any notes on expected mapping, validation or qualification
        changes (success numbers should not decrease)
    -   Additional data samples, if necessary
    -   Documentation adjustment, if necessary
    -   Release notes
    -   Any other additional materials or documentation that may help
        with the review and approval process

---
**Note:**
A contribution should be a whole [releasable
unit](#what-is-a-releasable-unit) and its size calibrated in accordance
with the CDM's [agile development
approach](#agile-development-approach).

---

### Contributing

Changes are contributed by submitting a Pull Request for review into the
CDM source-control repository. This pull request will invoke a build
process to compile and run all CDM unit tests and regression tests.

Given the alignment:

> 1 pull request = 1 contribution = 1 releasable unit = 1 user story,

we recommend labelling the pull request with the user story label, i.e.
"STORY-XYZ: ..." to facilitate its tracking.

---
**Note:**
All contributions are submitted as candidate changes to be incorporated
under [the CDM licence](https://portal.cdm.rosetta-technology.io/#/terms-isda).

---

When using Rosetta to contribute model changes, the contribution
interface allows to specify a title and description for the
contribution. Those inputs are used to create a Pull Request on a
one-off branch in the source-control repository. Please refer to the
[Rosetta Workspace Contribution Guide](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-products/1-workspace/#contribute-workspace-changes) for more information.

---
**Note:**
It is not yet possible to contribute updated test expectations,
documentation, release notes or new sample data using Rosetta, so these
must be provided to the CDM Maintainers via Slack or email.

---

### Documentation

The CDM documentation must be kept up-to-date with the model in
production. Where applicable, the Contributor should provide
accompanying documentation (in text format) that can be added to the CDM
documentation for their proposed changes.

The documentation includes code snippets that directly illustrate
explanations about certain model components, and those snippets are
validated against the actual model definitions. When a model change
impacts those snippets, or if new relevant snippets should be added to
support the documentation, those snippets should be provided together
with the documentation update.

### Release note

A release note should be provided with the proposed model change that
concisely describes the high-level conceptual design, model changes and
how to review. Please refer to the
[content-of-release-notes](#content-of-release-notes) for further
guidance on editing release notes.

## Reviewing model changes

### Review checklist

Before starting to review a contribution, the CDM Maintainer should go
through the following review checklist:

-   Review Pull Request to assert that:
    -   Model changes fulfil the proposed design and use-case
        requirements
    -   Synonyms have been updated and output (JSON) looks correct
    -   Contributed model version is not stale and does not conflict
        with any recent changes
    -   Changes are in accordance with the CDM governance guidelines

---
**Note:**
It is not yet possible to verify that mapping, validation and
qualification expectations have been maintained by looking at the output
of the Pull Request and CDM build only. Please refer to the
[downstream-dependencies](#downstream-dependencies) section for more
details.

---

-   CDM build process completed with no errors or test failures
-   Review additional samples provided (if use-case is not covered by
    existing samples)
-   All model components positioned in the correct namespace
-   All model components have descriptions
-   Additional documentation provided, if necessary.
-   Release note provided

Any review feedback should be sent to the Contributor as required via
Slack, email or in direct meetings.

---
**Note:**
Depending on the size, complexity or impact of a contribution, the CDM
Maintainer can recommend for the contribution to be presented with an
appropriate level of details with the CDM Architecture and Review
Committee for further feedback. The CDM Maintainer will work with the
Contributor to orchestrate that additional step. The additional feedback
may recommend revisions to the proposed changes. When it is the case the
review process will iterate on the revised proposal.

---

## Model maintenance

Before the Pull Request can be merged into the CDM's main branch, some
work is usually required by the Maintainer to preserve the integrity of
the model source code and of its downstream dependencies.

### Post-review technical tasks

A number of technical tasks may need to be performed on the Pull Request
once it is approved:

-   **Stale CDM version**: Contribution is based on an old CDM version
    and model changes conflict with more recent changes. If the
    conflicting change is available in Rosetta, the contributor should
    be asked to update their contribution to the latest version and
    resubmit. If the conflicting change is not yet available in Rosetta,
    this merge will need to be handled by the CDM Maintainer.
-   **Failed unit tests**: Java unit tests in the CDM project may fail
    due to problems in the contributed changes. Alternatively it may be
    that the test expectations need to be updated. The Maintainer should
    determine the cause of the test failure and notify either the
    Contributor or work on adjusting the test expectations.
-   **Additional documentation**: If the contributor provided additional
    documentation, the Maintainer should update the CDM documentation by
    editing the *documentation.rst* file in GitHub.
-   **Documentation code snippets**: To avoid stale documentation, the
    CDM build process verifies that any code snippets in the
    documentation exists and is in line with the model itself. The
    Maintainer should adjust or include any code snippets by editing the
    *documentation.rst* file on GitHub.
-   **Code generation**: Model changes may cause code generator failures
    (e.g., Java, C#, Scala, Kotlin etc.). In the unlikely event of code
    generation failures, these will need to be addressed by the
    Maintainer.

### Downstream dependencies

The CDM has a number of dependent projects that are required for the
model to be successfully distributed. It is possible that model changes
may cause these downstream projects to fail. The Maintainer will need to
test and, if necessary, update those before the changes can be released.

-   **Translate**: The regression tests in this project compare the
    contributed model against the expected number of mapping, validation
    and qualification results. Due to the contributed model changes, it
    is likely that there will be expectation mismatches that cause this
    build to fail.
-   **CDM Portal**: compile and test.
-   **CDM Java Examples**: compile and test.

---
**Note:**
In most cases, the post-review technical tasks and downstream
dependencies require software engineering expertise in addition to CDM
expertise. Additional technical support from the CDM Maintainer team may
need to be called upon to address those.

---

The change can be merged into the main CDM code base only upon:

-   approval by CDM Maintainers and/or CDM Architecture and Review
    Committee,
-   successful completion of all the above technical tasks, and
-   successful builds of the CDM and all its downstream dependencies.

## Releasing model changes

Once the contributed model change has been merged, a new release can be
built, tested and deployed. The Maintainer will work with the CDM Owners
and the Contributor on a deployment timeline.

The following release checklist should be verified before deploying a
new model:

-   Update the CDM version number, using the [semantic
    versioning](#semantic-versioning) format
-   Build release candidate, and test
-   Build documentation website release candidate, and test
-   Deploy release candidate and notify channels if need be
-   (Currently done at a later stage) Update the latest CDM version
    available in Rosetta

---
**Note:**
When the release process is handled through Rosetta Deploy, the
Maintainer should contact the Rosetta support team to request that
deployment and discuss a timeline for the release.

---

## Documentation Style Guide 

The purpose of this section is to provide form and substance
recommendations for editors of CDM documentation. "Documentation" in
this context means any form of written guidance to CDM users and
includes:

-   the CDM user documentation
-   release notes provided with each CDM release
-   any description developed in the logical model itself, which
    includes:
    -   data types and attributes
    -   enumerations
    -   functions and rules
    -   test descriptions
    -   any other areas of the logical model where a textual description
        may be provided

The intended audience for the CDM documentation includes software
developers, data modelers, legal experts, business experts, and other
subject matter experts who may have expertise in one area related to
financial products, but are not experts in every area.

The baseline for the recommendation is standards for spelling,
punctuation, and other style rules applicable to British English. The
recommendation in this document extends this rule set with a set of
guidelines applicable to documentation for logical models. The
recommendation does not provide an exhaustive list of all of the
standard British English rules, but provides selective examples that are
common to documentation in general.

Writing and editing style is subjective and a matter of personal
preferences, rather than right or wrong. The following guidelines are
intended to ensure that the documentation provides consistent styling,
regardless of who writes it, but should not be interpreted as an
authoritative source on "good" styling.

Unless otherwise noted, the recommended rules apply to all forms of CDM
documentation. When rules are applicable only to certain forms of
documentation (for instance, the logical model descriptions or the
release notes), they will be specified as such.

## Terminology

### The CDM

The model should be referred to as *the CDM*, without any ownership
mention. The only exception is the [Overview of the FINOS
CDM](/docs/cdm-overview) section at the beginning of the user
documentation when the CDM is introduced as *the FINOS CDM*.

### General data definition components

The two data definition components should be referred to as follows:

1.  *Data type*: defines an entity with a description, attributes, and
    where applicable, conditions.
    1.  Not *type*.
    2.  Not *class*: although these are appropriate terms for some of
        the distributions of the CDM into other languages, they are not
        applicable for all.
2.  *Attribute*: defines a member of a data type.
    1.  Not *field*.
    2.  Not *element*.

### Product

1.  *Financial Product*. The user documentation defines
    [financial-product](/docs/product-model#financial-product) as the highest
    level of the hierarchy of the universe of products. The term
    *Financial Product* should be used consistently throughout the
    documentation and wherever applicable in the model descriptions when
    describing the broad set of products.
2.  *Contractual Product*. Similarly,
    [contractual-product](/docs/product-model#contractual-product) is defined as a
    subset of Financial Products and should be used consistently in any
    documentation.
    1.  Not *Derivatives*.
    2.  Not *OTC*. Contractual Product is at a higher hierarchy level
        than OTC Derivatives because it can include other types of
        products such as Security Financing.

### Event

1.  *Business Event*. In the CDM, a [business-event](/docs/event-model#business-event) represents an event that may occur during the lifecycle
    of a trade, such as an amendment, a termination, a reset or a
    payment.
    1.  Not *Lifecycle Event*. the term *Business Event* should be
        consistently used when referring to these data structures in the
        CDM documentation.
2.  *Primitive Event*. In the CDM, a [primitive-event](/docs/event-model#primitive-event) represents a building block component used to specify
    business events in the CDM.
    1.  Not *Primitive* (stand-alone). In the CDM documentation, the
        word *Primitive* always needs to be qualified with *Event*,
        because the word *Primitive* may be associated to very different
        meanings, e.g. in computing.

## Completeness

### User Documentation

1.  The user documentation should provide an applicable introduction and
    should have a section for every primary component of the CDM.
2.  Each section should provide enough business context and explanations
    of the model so that the average reader in the target audience
    understands the purpose of the component and its role in the model.
3.  Each section should have at least one example of a data structure

### Logical Model

1.  Every data type, attribute, enumerated value, function, and test
    should have a description that describes its purpose in the context
    of the CDM.

## Accuracy

1.  Descriptions should accurately describe the current state of the
    model. This seems obvious, but there are many possible ways for
    introducing misalignments, including: an anticipated change never
    occurred, or the author incorrectly interpreted the structure, or
    the data structure changed while the documentation or description
    was not updated.
2.  Subtasks in a design process should include an assessment of
    documentation and descriptions that will be required to be changed
    or created, and should include the content.
3.  A release checklist should verify that the affected documentation
    and descriptions are completed accordingly.

## Content Guidelines

### General guidelines

1.  Data Definition components (e.g. data types, attributes,
    enumerations and enumerated values) should be explained in business
    terms.
    1.  The description of objects in the model should begin with the
        purpose of the object. The purpose should explain what the
        object is, not "what it is not".
    2.  Data type description should begin with a verb that describes
        what the type does.
    3.  The logical model identifies data types without needing a
        description, therefore, the description should not begin with a
        phrase like: "A data type that does..."
    4.  Attribute description should articulate the use of the type in
        the context of the attribute.
    5.  The description should not be tautological, e.g. PartyRole
        \<defines the party role\> is not compliant with these
        guidelines.
    6.  References to a similar attribute in FpML should not be used as
        a crutch in place of explaining a data type, attribute, etc.
    7.  In most cases, where a reference to FpML is considered useful,
        it should be placed at the end of a description in the logical
        model, or in a note at the end of a section in the user
        documentation. In the case of the logical model, note that
        synonyms for FpML are provided, therefore it should not be
        necessary to reference FpML in every case.

Example of a non-compliant description:

``` sourcecode
<"A data type to represent a financial product. With respect to contractual products, this class specifies the pre-execution product characteristics (the ContractualProduct class). This class is used as underlying for the option exercise representation, which makes use of the contractualProduct attribute to support the swaption use case, with the exercise into a swap. In a complete workflow, the swaption contract itself then needs to be superseded by a swap contract underpinned by the exercised swap as a contractualProduct.">
```

Instead a compliant description would state:

``` sourcecode
<"Represents a financial product. With respect to a contractual products, this data type specifies the pre-execution product characteristics...”>
```

Another non-compliant example:

``` sourcecode
<"This class corresponds to the FpML CalculationAgent.model.">
```

2.  The description of data objects or the overall model should be
    focused on the current state, there should be no reference to the
    history of the model or a future state.
    1.  The history of the model is not relevant in this context. It is
        sufficient to describe how the model currently works.
    2.  Forward-looking statements can create a perception that the
        product is not finished, and become a distraction to explaining
        what the product does. Moreover, these future plans may never
        materialise.
    3.  Given these rules, phrases such as "the model currently
        does...." should be excluded because any documentation must be a
        description of what the model currently does.

### Heading styles and flow in the user documentation

1.  Heading styles. The user documentation is edited in the *RST
    (reStructured Text)* mark-up language, which is then rendered into
    Html in the CDM documentation website using *Sphinx*. For headings
    to be rendered with the correct structure, they should be annotated
    according to the following table:
    1.  If using a header to identify a section to describe a component,
        then use headers to describe other components that are at the
        same level.
    2.  Sub-headings should have a name distinct from the higher level
        heading. e.g. if Legal Agreement is the Heading Level 2, then
        there should not be a heading at level 3 or 4 with the exact
        same title.

| Heading Level |    Notation (underline in .rst)    | Relative font size (as seen by users) |                                          Section Example |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------:|--------------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1             |        _[===============]_         |                      XL font and bold |         [common-domain-model](/docs/common-domain-model) |
| 2             | _[\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\--]_  |                       L font and bold |               [product-model-page](/docs/product-model),<br/>[legal-agreements-page](/docs/legal-agreements) |
| 3             | _[\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^]_ |                       M font and bold | [tradable-product](/docs/product-model#tradable-product) |
| 4             | _["""""""""""""""]_ |     S font (same ascontent), but bold |     [price-quantity](/docs/product-model#price-quantity) |
:Heading Styles

The RST editing syntax in which the user documentation is written is a
standard web mark-up language, for which a reference guide can be found
at: <https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io>

2.  Logical organization and order:
    1.  The user documentation should walk the user through the model
        from the top down, beginning at a description of the primary
        components.
    2.  Levels 1 and 2 should include a bullet point list of the sub
        sections that will be described (bullets formatted with the
        insertion of an asterisk followed by a space).
3.  Define business terms and CDM terminology early in a section so that
    the broader audience understands the model.
4.  Details about a topic should be presented in the section for that
    topic:
    1.  In the case of a model component, the description of the
        component should always be followed by an example.
    2.  Most or all of the explanation should occur before the example,
        not after, unless the example was needed as context for an
        explanation.
    3.  Transitions from one topic to another should be used to help
        guide the user through the model.

### Content of Release Notes

Release notes are text describing the content of any new CDM release and
are a critical component of the distribution of that release. Release
notes are edited in the *Mark-Down (MD)* syntax, which is then rendered
into Html in the various channels where the release is published.

1.  Release notes should begin with a high-level headline of the part of
    the model being changed, followed by "--" and a short headline
    description
    1.  For example: "# Legal Agreement Model - Collateral Agreement
        Elections"
2.  They should provide enough detail for a reviewer or other interested
    parties to be able to find and evaluate the change. For a data model
    change, for example, the data type and attributes should be named
    and the before/after states of the model explained, along with a
    justification in which the issue is summarised.
3.  They should also embed a link to the Pull Request containing the change, to enable users to inspect those changes in details.
4.  If the release notes describe mapping rules, there should be
    explicit information about the examples affected and the change in
    resulting values for those examples.
5.  If the release is documentation, it should specify exactly where the
    document was changed and why.
6.  Special formatting rules related to use of the MD mark-up language:
    1.  Headline should begin with a `#`, as in the above example, so
        that it appears correctly formatted in Html
    2.  `*` before and after text (no space) for bold
    3.  `_` before and after text (no space) for italics
    4.  `–` (plus a space) for bullets
    5.  Backticks ``\` before and after model components, e.g. data
        types, attributes, enums, function names, etc. for special
        code-style formatting

Example release notes formatted in MD:

``` MD
# *CDM Model: Expanded set of enumerations in RegulatoryRegimeEnum*

_What is being released_

Additional regimes have been added to the `RegulatoryRegimeEnum` which is used to express the required regimes for initial margin documentation. The `RegulatoryRegimeEnum` is used as an enumeration for attributes in the `ApplicableRegime` and `SubstitutedRegime` data types within the legal agreements model.

The new enumerated values are `BrazilMarginRules`, `UnitedKingdomMarginRules`, `SouthAfricaMarginRules`, `SouthKoreaMarginRules`, and `HongKongSFCMarginRules`, all of which have come into force in January 2021.  Each of these enumerated values has a complete description that uses the text provided in the relevant regulatory supplement.

_Review directions_

In the CDM Portal select the Textual Browser, search for ‘ApplicableRegime’ and ‘SubstitutedRegime’, click on the ‘RegulatoryRegimeEnum’ next to the ‘regime’ attribute and observe the expanded list of regimes, including the ones noted above.

Inspect Pull Request: [#1101](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/pull/1101)

```

The MD editing syntax in which release notes are written is a standard
web mark-up language, for which a reference guide can be found at:
<https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/>

---
**Note:**
The MD syntax provides similar features to the RST syntax (used to edit
the user documentation), but the special formatting characters are
slightly different between the two. While RST allows richer features
that are useful for a full documentation website, MD is preferred for
release notes because Slack supports (a subset of) the MD language and
can therefore serve as a release publication channel.

---

## Style

### Content style

1.  Content should be correct with regard to grammar, punctuation, and
    spelling (in British English), including but not limited to the
    following rules:
    1.  Grammatical agreement, e.g. data types need, not data types
        needs
    2.  Punctuation:
        1.  etc. requires a period.
        2.  Complete sentences should end with a period or colon (there
            should be no need for a question mark or exclamation point
            in these artefacts).
        3.  Incomplete sentences cannot end with a punctuation. For
            example, "Through the `legalAgreement` attribute the CDM
            provides support for implementors to:" is an incomplete
            sentence and cannot end in a punctuation. This can be fixed
            by adding a few words, e .g. "Through the `legalAgreement`
            attribute the CDM provides support for implementors to do
            the following:"
        4.  Always use the Oxford Comma (aka the Serial Comma) for
            clarity when listing more than two items in a sentence, e.g.
            "data types, attributes, and enumerated values." In extreme
            cases, failure to use this comma could be costly.
2.  Other grammatical rules
    1.  Agreement of numbers: For example, if one sentence reads "the
        following initiatives..." , then it should be followed by more
        than one.
    2.  Sentences should not end with a preposition
        1.  Non-compliant example: "..to represent the party that the
            election terms are being defined for."
        2.  Compliant: "...to represent the party or parties for which
            the election terms are being defined."
3.  When a name or phrase is defined - continue to use it unless an
    alias has been defined. For example, one section reviewed had an
    expression "agreement specification details" but then switched to
    using "agreement content" without explanation. There is sufficient
    terminology to absorb, as such there is no need for synonyms or
    aliases, unless there are commonly used terms, in which case, they
    should be defined and one term should be used consistently.
4.  User Documentation and descriptions should always be in the third
    person, for example: "the CDM model provides the following...".
    Never use the first person (including the use of "we").
5.  In the user documentation, when there is a need for a long list, use
    bullets (`*` or `-` followed by space, then text) as opposed to long
    sentences.
6.  To the extent possible, use simple direct sentence structures, e.g.
    replace "An example of such" with "For example", or replace
    "Proposals for amendment to the CDM can be created upon the
    initiative of members of a Committee or by any users of CDM within
    the community who are not a current Committee member." with
    "Committee members or any user of CDM within the community can
    propose amendments to the CDM."
7.  Exclude the usage of "mean to", "intends to", or "looks to".
    1.  For example, "the model looks to use strong data type
        attributes such as numbers, boolean or enumerations whenever
        possible."
    2.  Either the object works as designed or it does not. This
        expression might be used in a bug report when describing a
        function not working as intended but not to describe a
        production data model.
8.  Explain the CDM objects in an honest and transparent manner, but
    without criticism of the model. Sentences such as: "...which firms
    may deem inappropriate and may replace by..." or "the model is
    incomplete with regards to..." are unnecessary in a documentation.
    Rather, issues which may be identified in the CDM should be raised
    and addressed via the CDM governance structure.

### Special format for CDM objects

1.  Data types and attributes display rules:
    1.  Data types and attributes should be identified in the editor
        with code quotes, where the text between the quotes will appear
        in a special block format as illustrated here:
        `LegalAgreementBase`.
    2.  If the same word or phrase is used in a business context, as
        part of an explanation, then the words should be spaced and
        titled normally and the special format is not required: e.g.
        "Tradable products are represented by...".
2.  Code snippets should be preceded by the string:
    `.. code-block:: Language` (where the Language could be any of
    Haskell, Java, JSON, etc.), followed by a line spacing before the
    snippet itself. The entire snippet should be indented with one
    space, to be identified as part of the code block and formatted
    appropriately. Indentation can be produced inside the snippet itself
    using further double space. Meta-data such as data type descriptions
    or synonyms that appear in the CDM should be excluded from the code
    snippet, unless the purpose of the snippet is to illustrate those.

Example of how a code snippet should be edited in the documentation:

``` MD
.. code-block:: Haskell

 type Party:
   [metadata key]
   partyId PartyIdentifier (1..*)
   name string (0..1)
     [metadata scheme]
   businessUnit BusinessUnit (0..*)
   person NaturalPerson (0..*)
   personRole NaturalPersonRole (0..*)
   account Account (0..1)
   contactInformation ContactInformation (0..1)
```

And the result will be rendered as:

``` Haskell
type Party:
  [metadata key]
  partyId PartyIdentifier (1..*)
  name string (0..1)
    [metadata scheme]
  businessUnit BusinessUnit (0..*)
  person NaturalPerson (0..*)
  personRole NaturalPersonRole (0..*)
  account Account (0..1)
  contactInformation ContactInformation (0..1)
```

**Note:**
Code snippets that appear in the user documentation are being compared
against actual CDM components during the CDM build process, and any
mismatch will trigger an error in the build. This mechanism ensures that
the user documentation is kept in sync with the model in production
prior to any release.

### Fonts, Text Styles, and Spaces

1.  Bold should be used sparingly:
    1.  Only in the beginning of a section when there is a salient point
        to emphasize, like a tag line - the bold line should be
        syntactically complete and correct.
    2.  In the editor, bold is specified with double asterisks before
        and after the word or phrase.
2.  Italics
    1.  Italics should be used when defining an unusual term for the
        first time rather than using quotes, for example to identify
        something CDM specific, such as the concept of Primitive Events.
    2.  In the editor, italics is specified with a single asterisk `*`
        before and after the word or phrase.
3.  Single space should be used in-between sentences, not double space.
