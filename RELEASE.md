# *ICMA Contribution - Removal of Deprecated Components*

_Background_

As part of ICMA's contribution to the CDM for Repo and Bonds, several model components that have been ear-marked as deprecated need to be removed. Those component are now supersded by new components from that contribution.

_What is being released?_

This release removes the following deprecated components:

**Data types**

- `SecurityFinancePayout` (superseded by `AssetPayout`)
- `SecurityFinanceLeg` (superseded by `AssetLeg`)

**Attributes**

- In `Payout` and `SettlementOrigin`: `securityFinancePayout` (superseded by `assetPayout`)
- In `Collateral`: `marginPercentage` (already represented within `eligibleCollateral`)
- In `ProductTaxonomy`: `taxonomySource` and `taxonomyValue` (superseded by `source` and `value` in `Taxonomy` super-type)
- In `AssignedIdentifier`: `identifierType` (moved to `TradeIdentifier`)

**Annotations**

- In `ExecutionDetails`: the `[metadata reference]` annotation for `packageReference`

**Functions**

In addition, the functional model has been amended as follows:

- The logic previously relying on the `securityFinancePayout` attribute now uses `assetPayout` and `collateral->collateralProvisions`, including the sec-lending product and event qualification logic. The functions impacted are:

  - `CalculateTransfer`
  - `Create_SecurityTransfer`
  - `Create_SecurityFinanceTransfer`
  - `ResolveTransfer`
  - `SecurityFinanceCashSettlementAmount`
  - `Create_BillingRecord`
  - `ResolveSecurityFinanceBillingAmount`
  - `Create_AssetPayoutTradeStateWithObservations`
  - `Qualify_SecurityLendingAgreement`
  - `Qualify_Repurchase`
  - `Qualify_FullReturn`
  
- The sec-lending samples and mappers have been adjusted to reflect the new structure
- Function names referring to "Security Finance" have replaced it with the more generic "Asset"
- Model descriptions that use the term "Security Finance Payout" have replaced it with "Asset Payout"

**Other**

- Various comments that were left-over from the contribution have been removed
