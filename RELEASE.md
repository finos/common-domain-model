# *Documentation - How to Contribute and Doc Style Guide sections*

_What is being released?_

The documentation has been updated to accomodate an increasing number of contributors to the CDM from the industry community.

The documentation now contains an "How to Contribute" section that details the practical responsibilities of both the Contributor and the Reviewer in the process, in accordance with the CDM governance guidelines, and the subsequent deployment process.

As any contribution needs to include its own documentation update and release notes, a "Documentation Style Guide" section has been provided to ensure on-going consistency in the CDM documentation which may be sourced from many different writers.
