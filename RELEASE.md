# _Collateral Model - Updated descriptions for ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum_

_Background_

It has been raised that there is some ambiguity with the attribute descriptions under the `ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum`.
The word portfolio could mean several things; therefore, the CDM Collateral Working Group agreed to add additional language across the descriptions to ensure they indicate the collateral schedule being listed in the collateral criteria and avoid misinterpretation.

_What is being released?_

Updates to descriptions for `ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum` listings to remove 'portfolio' and replace this with 'eligible collateral schedule' where relevant and required.

_Review Directions_

The changes can be reviewed in PR: [#4026](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/pull/4026)
