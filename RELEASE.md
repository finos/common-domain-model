# _Product Model - Commodity Forwards_

_Background_

This release provides qualification support for Commodity Forward products, which were not supported until now. The representation of commodity forwards pictures two possible kinds of forwards: fixed price forwards consisting in the combination of a `fixedPricePayout` and a `forwardPayout`; and floating price forwards consisting in the combination of a `commodityPayout` and a `forwardPayout`. The `forwardPayout` represents the physical delivery of the commodity while the other payout represents its pricing and the payment of a monetary amount in exchange.

_What is being released?_

- Added the qualifying function `Qualify_Commodity_Forward`.
- Updated the qualifying function `Qualify_AssetClass_Commodity` in order to consider commodity forwards.
