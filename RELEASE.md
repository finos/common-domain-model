# CDM Version 6.0

CDM 6.0, a production release, corresponds to developments made to the Common Domain Model throughout 2024 and previously released as CDM 6-dev. These developments include items that featured in the 2024 CDM roadmap:

- Option Payout Refactoring
- Asset Refactoring
- Standardized IM Schedule

as well as several additional model changes, bug fixes and synonym mappings since the latest production release (CDM 5.20).

## _What is being released_

The release includes changes to the CDM model itself (manifested in changes to .rosetta source files) but also enhancements to:
- The [CDM Documentation](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/cdm-overview/), which should be consulted as a good resource to understand the enhanced design of products and
  business events in CDM 6.
- The [CDM Sample Files](https://github.com/rosetta-models/common-domain-model/blob/master/rosetta-source/src/main/resources/cdm-sample-files), which have been updated to reflect the new modelling designs.
- The [CDM Object Builder](https://cdm-object-builder.finos.org/), which can be used to construct CDM objects and generate JSON serialised data.

Below are some of the high-level modelling changes included in CDM 6.0, with links to their corresponding development release tags containing more detailed release notes.

### _Asset refactoring_

A major feature of CDM 6 is the refactored product model with the introduction of the concept of Asset.  This is the result of a CDM task force which came together to
extend the model into additional asset classes and to address some long-standing challenges.  The objectives and design artefacts of the task force were documented in
[GitHub Issue 2805](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/2805).

This diagram shows the new product model at a high level; please read the [FINOS CDM documentation](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/product-model) for a full explanation:

## _Backward-incompatible changes_

### _Asset refactoring_

_Main changes using the choice data type_

A new feature in the Rune DSL - the [choice data type](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-dsl/rune-modelling-component/) - has been used extensively for the asset refactoring in CDM 6.

Example of new items defined as `choice` types include:
- `Asset`
- `Instrument`

In addition, some fundamental data types previously defined using a `one-of` condition have been updated to `choice` types. Compared to the regular `one-of` condition, choice types force each of the choice options to have single cardinality.
- `Product`: defined as a choice between `TransferableProduct` (which extends `Asset`) and `NonTransferableProduct` (renamed from `ContractualProduct`, previously included in `Product`). Other data types previously included in `Product` are now defined as `Asset` or `Observable` choices instead:
    - `Commodity`: now extends `AssetBase` not `ProductBase`.
        - Accordingly, `productTaxonomy` has been replaced by `taxonomy` and the conditions updated.
    - `Security` and `Loan`: now extend `InstrumentBase` not `ProductBase`.
    - `Basket`: now extends `AssetBase` not `ProductBase`.
        - `BasketConstituent` now extends `Observable` not `Product`.
        - Moved from the `product` namespace to the `observable` namespace.
    - `Index`: now extends `IndexBase` not `ProductBase`
    - `ForeignExchange` has been marked as deprecated.
        - The deprecated `ExchangeRate` and `CrossRate` data types have both been deleted.
    - `AssetPool`: removed (it was previously introduced from FpML but has been found to be incorrect and unusable).
        - Removed the reference to `AssetPool` from `Product`.
- `Observable`: defined as a choice between `Asset`, `Index` and `Basket`. In addition, the following attributes have been removed from `Observable`:
    - `Commodity`: now available directly as an `Asset`.
    - `QuotedCurrencyPair`: replaced by the the FX observable data type inside `Index`.
    - The unused attribute `optionReferenceType` and its corresponding enumerator `OptionReferenceTypeEnum` have been removed from the model.
- `FloatingRateOption`: renamed as `InterestRateIndex`, and updated to be a choice between `FloatingRateIndex` and `InflationIndex`.
    - Update the `rateOption` attribute on `FloatingRateBase` to be of type `InterestRateIndex`, since it is used for both floating and inflation indices.
    - The following two functions have been moved from the `cdm.observable.asset.fro` namespace to the `cdm.observable.asset` namespace, as they act on an interest rate index and not just a floating rate index:
        - `IndexValueObservation`
        - `IndexValueObservationMultiple`
- `Payout`: defined as a choice between different types of payout. Because some payout types were previously defined with multiple cardinality, attributes using the `Payout` type (for example in `EconomicTerms` or `ResetInstruction`) now have multiple cardinality. Also removed from `Payout`:
    - `SecurityPayout`: deleted type.
    - `Cashflow`: use in the `ForeignExchange` data type also deprecated.
    - `ForwardPayout`: renamed to `SettlementPayout` and usage broadened to cover the settlement of any underlier, whether on a current date or forward basis, for either physical or cash settlement.

All references to choice types need to be updated because they are now treated as Capitalised Data Types rather than lower case attributes. For example, a previous reference might have read:
```
payout -> interestRatePayout -> floatingAmount
```
and must now be written as:
```
payout -> InterestRatePayout -> floatingAmount
```
This capitalisation also applies to the CDM's serialisation format (JSON).

_Other data type and attribute changes_

- Tradable product:
    -  `Trade` extends `TradableProduct` instead of containing it as an attribute.
    -  The `product` attribute in `TradableProduct` can only be a `NonTransferableProduct` (previously it could be any `Product`).
- Removed the following deprecated data types used in the Product Model:
    - `Bond`
    - `ConvertibleBond`
    - `Equity`
    - `IdentifiedProduct`
    - `ObservationSource`
    - `SecurityPayout`
        - Also removed the functions which act upon `SecurityPayout`.
    - Removed the following deprecated data types related to the deprecated `SecurityPayout`:
        - `SecurityLeg`
        - `InitialMargin`
        - `InitialMarginCalculation`
        - `SecurityValuation`
        - `SecurityValuationModel`
        - `BondValudationModel`
        - `BondPriceAndYieldModel`
        - `CleanOrDirtyPrice`
        - `CleanPrice`
        - `RelativePrice`
        - `BondEquityModel`
        - `BondChoiceModel`
        - `UnitContractValuationModel`.
- Refactoring of `ObservationTerms`:
    - The two attributes `pricingTime` and `pricingTimeType` on `ObservationTerms` have been renamed `observationTime` and `observationTimeType`, respectively.
- Changes to `Transfer`:
    - The modelling of `Transfer` has been refactored to act upon `Asset` rather than `Observable`, in line with the definition of `Asset` as something that can be transferred.
    - `TransferBase` has been deleted from the model and replaced by `AssetFlowBase`, which is also extended by the `Cashflow` type.
- Refactored eligible collateral
    - `AssetCriteria` and `IssuerCriteria` have been replaced by a refactored and combined `CollateralCriteria`.
    - The `qualifier` attribute has been removed from `AgencyRatingCriteria`, as it is now redundant.
    - The data type `ListingType` has been removed.
- Security finance:
    - Rename `RepoTypeEnum` to `AssetPayoutTradeTypeEnum`.
    - Rename the `repoType` attribute to `tradeType` on `AssetPayout`.

_Sample Impact_

The changes listed above have significant impact to serialised data when the CDM is represented in JSON.  All of the impacted sample files in the FINOS CDM distribution have been updated accordingly.

The following examples are shown here to illustrate these changes:

#### 1. Impact of the refactoring of the `Trade` - `TradableProduct` - `EconomicTerms` hierarchy

This example is of a vanilla interest rate swap.  In CDM 5, the structure appeared as follows:

``` json
{
  "trade" : {
    "tradableProduct" : {
      "product" : {
        "contractualProduct" : {
          "productTaxonomy" : [ {
            "source" : "ISDA",
            "productQualifier" : "InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat"
          } ],
          "economicTerms" : {
            "payout" : {
              "interestRatePayout" : [ {
                "payerReceiver" : {
                } 
          } ] } }
} } } } }  
```

In CDM 6,
- tradableProduct and contractualProduct no longer appear as they have been collapsed into `product`
- productTaxonomy is now just `Taxonomy`
- `InterestRatePayout` is capitalised as it is now a choice data type

These differences can be seen in this sample:

``` json
{
  "trade" : {
    "product" : {
      "taxonomy" : [ {
        "source" : "ISDA",
        "productQualifier" : "InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat"
      } ],
      "economicTerms" : {
        "payout" : [ {
          "InterestRatePayout" : {
            "payerReceiver" : {
	    }
} } ] } } } }
```

#### 2. Example of a foreign exchange contract using a `SettlementPayout`

In CDM 5, foreign exchange was represented using a Forward Payout containing a Foreign Exchange underlier (some terms omitted for clarity):

``` json
{
  "trade" : {

    "tradableProduct" : {
      "product" : {
        "contractualProduct" : {
          "productTaxonomy" : [ {
            "source" : "ISDA",
            "productQualifier" : "ForeignExchange_Spot_Forward"
          } ],
          "economicTerms" : {
            "payout" : {
              "forwardPayout" : [ {
                "settlementTerms" : {
                  "settlementDate" : {
                    "valueDate" : "2001-10-25",
                },
                "underlier" : {
                  "foreignExchange" : {
                    "exchangedCurrency1" : {

                      },
                      "priceQuantity" : {

                        }
                    },
                    "exchangedCurrency2" : {

                      },
                      "priceQuantity" : {

                        }
                    }
} } ] } } } } } } }
```

In CDM 6, these trades are represented using a `SettlementPayout` where the underlier is a cash asset:

``` json
{
  "trade" : {
    "product" : {
      "taxonomy" : [ {
        "source" : "ISDA",
        "productQualifier" : "ForeignExchange_Spot_Forward"
      } ],
      "economicTerms" : {
        "payout" : [ {
          "SettlementPayout" : {
             
            "settlementTerms" : {
              "settlementDate" : {
                "valueDate" : "2001-10-25"
              }
            },
            "underlier" : {
              "Observable" : {
                "address" : {
                  "scope" : "DOCUMENT",
                  "value" : "observable-1"
                }
} } } } ] } } } }
```

The second currency reflected in the `tradeLot`:

``` json
{
   "tradeLot" : [ {
      "priceQuantity" : [ {
        "price" : [ {
          "value" : {
            "value" : 1.48,
            "unit" : {
              "currency" : {
                "value" : "USD"
              }
            },
            "perUnitOf" : {
              "currency" : {
                "value" : "GBP"
              }
            },
            "priceType" : "ExchangeRate"
          }
        } ],
        "quantity" : [ {
          "value" : {
            "value" : 10000000,
            "unit" : {
              "currency" : {
                "value" : "GBP"
              }
            }
          }
        }, {
          "value" : {
            "value" : 14800000,
            "unit" : {
              "currency" : {
                "value" : "USD"
              }
            }
          }
        } ],
        "observable" : {
          "value" : {
            "Asset" : {
              "Cash" : {
                "identifier" : [ {
                  "identifier" : {
                    "value" : "GBP"
                  },
                  "identifierType" : "CurrencyCode"
                } ]
              }
            }
          }
} } ] } ] }
```

#### 3. Securities Financing

CDM 5 treated both repos and securities lending trades in a similar manner and was unable to differentiate between the two in product qualification.

The modelling typically:
- qualified all securities financing products as "SecuritiesFinance"
- consisted of a `ContractualProduct` with a single `InterestRatePayout` in the `EconomicTerms`
- used a `Collateral` object with an `AssetPayout` for the security being either repurchased or lent.

Sample (some terms omitted for clarity):

``` json
{
  "trade" : {

    "tradableProduct" : {
      "product" : {
        "contractualProduct" : {
          "productTaxonomy" : [ {
            "source" : "ISDA",
            "productQualifier" : "SecuritiesFinance"
          } ],
          "economicTerms" : {
            "effectiveDate" : {

            },
            "terminationDate" : {
            },
            "payout" : {
              "interestRatePayout" : [ {
                "payerReceiver" : {
                  "payer" : "Party1",
                  "receiver" : "Party2"
                }
				
} ] } } } } } } }
```

with Collateral (some terms omitted for clarity):

``` json
{ 
  "collateral" : {
    "collateralPortfolio" : [ {
      "value" : {
        "collateralPosition" : [ {
          "product" : {
            "contractualProduct" : {
              "economicTerms" : {
                "payout" : {
                  "assetPayout" : [ {
                    "payerReceiver" : {
                      "payer" : "Party1",
                      "receiver" : "Party2"
                    },
                    "assetLeg" : [ {
                      "settlementDate" : {
  
                          },
                      "deliveryMethod" : "DeliveryVersusPayment"
                    }, {
                    "securityInformation" : {
                      "security" : {
                        "productIdentifier" : [ {
                          "value" : {
                            "identifier" : {
                              "value" : "ST001"
                            },

#### 3.1 Example of a Repurchase Agreement

CDM 6 offers enhanced support for repurchase agreements, replacing the implementation of securities financing in section 3 above.  A repurchase agreement:
- qualifies as "RepurchaseAgreement"
- is composed of a `Product` a single `InterestRatePayout` in the `EconomicTerms` to represent the principal payment
- and a `Collateral` definition with a `TransferableProduct` for the asset being exchanged

Example of the product structure (some terms omitted for clarity):

``` json
{
  "trade" : {
    "product" : {
      "taxonomy" : [ {
        "source" : "ISDA",
        "productQualifier" : "RepurchaseAgreement"
      } ],
      "economicTerms" : {
        "effectiveDate" : {

          }
        },
        "terminationDate" : {

        },
        "payout" : [ {
          "InterestRatePayout" : {
            "payerReceiver" : {
              "payer" : "Party1",
              "receiver" : "Party2"
            },
            "priceQuantity" : {

            },
            "principalPayment" : {
              "initialPayment" : true,
              "finalPayment" : true,
              "intermediatePayment" : false,
              "meta" : {
                "globalKey" : "12a6f5"
              }
            },
            "rateSpecification" : {
              "FixedRateSpecification" : {
                "rateSchedule" : {
                  "price" : {

                  }
} } } } } ] } } }
```

and the collateral structure:

``` json
{
  "collateral" : {
    "collateralPortfolio" : [ {
      "value" : {
        "collateralPosition" : [ {
          "product" : {
            "TransferableProduct" : {
              "Instrument" : {
                "Security" : {
                  "identifier" : [ {
                    "identifier" : {
                      "value" : "GB00B24FF097"
                    },
                    "identifierType" : "ISIN"
                  } ]
                }
              }
} } } ] } } ] } }
```

#### 3.2 Example of a Securities Lending trade

CDM 6 offers enhanced support for securities lending, replacing the implementation of securities financing in section 3 above. Securities Lending trades are represented:
- using a product that qualifies as "SecurityLending"
- composed of Economic Terms with a single `AssetPayout` with a `Security` underlier for the asset being lent
- with the cash payment modelled within a `Collateral` object with a transferable product composed of a `Cash` asset with an `InterestRatePayout`.
A non-cash collateral trade would have a `Collateral` definition with a `TransferableProduct` for the asset(s) being used as collateral.

This can be seen in this sample (some items omitted for clarity):

``` json
{
  "product" : {
    "taxonomy" : [ {
      "source" : "ISDA",
      "productQualifier" : "SecurityLending"
    } ],
    "economicTerms" : {
      "effectiveDate" : {

      },
      "terminationDate" : {

        }
      },
      "payout" : [ {
        "AssetPayout" : {
          "payerReceiver" : {

          },
          "priceQuantity" : {

          },
          "assetLeg" : [ {
            "settlementDate" : {
              "adjustableDate" : {

                },
                "adjustedDate" : {
                  "value" : "2020-09-22"
            },
            "deliveryMethod" : "DeliveryVersusPayment"
          }, 
          "underlier" : {
            "Instrument" : {
              "Security" : {
                "identifier" : [ {
                  "identifier" : {
                    "value" : "ST001"
                  },
                  "identifierType" : "SEDOL"
                } ],
                "instrumentType" : "Equity"
              }
            }
          }

      } ],
      "collateral" : {
        "collateralPortfolio" : [ {

                      },
                      "identifierType" : "CurrencyCode"

                          }
} } ] } } } } ] } } ] } } } ] } }
```




### _Option Payout refactoring_

_Data types and enumeration changes_

- Removed `OptionStyle` type and the three option exercise types contained inside it: `AmericanExercise`, `EuropeanExercise`, `BermudaExercise`.
- Replaced these with new `OptionExerciseStyleEnum` enumeration with values `American`, `European` and `Bermuda`.
- Removed `OptionExercise` type.
- Replaced these with new `ExerciseTerms` type, containing:
    - all of the distinct attributes present before in `AmericanExercise`, `EuropeanExercise`, and `BermudaExercise` types,
    - a `style` attribute of type `OptionExerciseStyleEnum`,
    - and the `exerciseProcedure` attribute of type `ExerciseProcedure` that was previously contained in `OptionExercise`.
- Switched `exerciseTerms` attribute in `OptionPayout` type to use the new `ExerciseTerms` type instead of the removed `OptionExercise` type.
- Moved the `strike` attribute previously contained in `OptionExercise` type to `OptionPayout` type.
- Removed `americanExercise`, `europeanExercise`, and `bermudaExercise` attributes from `CancelableProvision`, `ExtendibleProvision`, and `OptionalEarlyTermination` types.

_Sample Impact_

There are many samples impacted by this change, namely all the samples utilizing the `OptionPayout` structure. The impact on the three following samples (one European, one American, one Bermuda) is shown to visualize how the refactoring of the `OptionPayout` affects the structure of the CDM trades:

- `eqd ex04 european call index long form`: the `OptionStyle` has been removed in favor of the the `style` = "European", and the relevant fields previously under `europeanExercise` (`expirationDate` and `expirationTimeType`). Additionally, the `strike` is moved from inside `exerciseTerms` to outside.

### _Misc. renaming or deletion_

- RBA Bond Basis
    - Replaced the codes `RBA_BOND_BASIS_QUARTER`, `RBA_BOND_BASIS_SEMI_ANNUAL` and `RBA_BOND_BASIS_ANNUAL` with the code `RBA_BOND_BASIS` in `DayCountFractionEnum`.
    - Mapping added to populate the new code from the FpML code `RBA`.
- Portfolio Return Terms
    - Removed `[deprecated]` attributes below from type `PriceReturnTerms`:
        - `valuationPriceInitial`
        - `valuationPriceFinal`
    - Replaced by existing attributes in `PerformancePayout`:
        - `initialValuationPrice`
        - `finalValuationPrice`
    - Renamed attributes in `ValuationDates`:
        - `initialValuationDate` instead of `valuationDatesInitial`
        - `interimValuationDate` instead of `valuationDatesInterim`
        - `finalValuationDate` instead of `valuationDatesFinal`
    - Updated `Basket` type:
        - Renamed `portfolioBasketConstituent` of type `BasketConstituent` as simply `basketConstituent`.
        - Removed `[deprecated]` `basketConstituent` attribute, previously of type `Product`.
- Natural person
    - Removed the `personRole` attribute of type `NaturalPersonRole` from `NaturalPerson`.
    - Replaced by existing `personRole` attribute in `Party`.

### _Misc. data validation changes_

- Exotic Equity Products and Exercise Terms validation conditions
    - Attribute `expirationTime` relaxed to be optional (previously mandatory).
    - Attribute `expirationTimeType` tightened to be mandatory (previously optional).
    - Addition of validation condition `ExpirationTimeChoice` to establish the correlation between `expirationTime` and `expirationTimeType`.
    - Affected samples have been updated to ensure that `expirationTimeType` is populated as `SpecificTime` when the `expirationTime` attribute is populated. See for example: [`fpml-5-13 > fx-ex09-euro-opt`](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/blob/master/rosetta-source/src/main/resources/cdm-sample-files/fpml-5-13/products/fx-derivatives/fx-ex09-euro-opt.xml).
