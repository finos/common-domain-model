# _Event Workflow - Updated constraints for Event WorkflowStep condition_

_Background_

The condition CounterPartyPositionBusinessEventOrBusinessEventChoice appears to be designed to ensure that counterpartyPositionBusinessEvent and businessEvent are not both present simultaneously. However, its current structure - as a required choice - needs selecting one of these elements each time WorkflowStep is used.
It has been observed that proposedEvent, which specifies the required inputs for a transition before a business event is fully formed, does not include either counterpartyPositionBusinessEvent or businessEvent. While these fields are not necessary at this stage, their mandatory status results in a validation issue when neither is provided. Further details on the background context can be found in Issue [3681](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/3681).

_What is being released?_

This contribution modifies the required choice within the model. Previously, the choice was between businessEvent and counterpartyPositionBusinessEvent. It has now been updated to a required choice between proposedEvent, businessEvent, and counterpartyPositionBusinessEvent. Correspondingly, the condition name has been updated to CounterpartyPositionBusinessEventOrBusinessEventOrProposedEventChoice to reflect this expanded set of options.

Impact on valid states:
- Instances containing only businessEvent remain valid
- Instances containing only counterpartyPositionBusinessEvent remain valid
- A new valid state is introduced: instances containing only proposedEvent
- Instances containing none of these three elements remain invalid (as it's still a required choice)
- New invalid state is introduced: Instances containing more than one of these three elements are invalid

Additionally, the definitions of elements within workflowStep, specifically businessEvent and proposedEvent, have been revised. It was previously assumed that a proposedEvent could coexist with a businessEvent. This assumption has been removed, and the model now enforces that only one of these elements can be present at a time, in alignment with the updated choice constraint.
