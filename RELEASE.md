# *Legal Documentation Model - Rename Legal Agreement Namespace to Legal Document*

_Background_

As part of the transition of the Core CDM to a new repository, an analysis of the present CDM namespaces has been undertaken. A number of appropriate but minor changes have been identified which will be rolled out in coming weeks. One of which is to rename the namespace where legal agreement data models have been developed to be more generic and appropriate name and reposition some of the collateral work which may be more appropriately held in a namespace in the cdm.product namespace. 

_What is being released?_

The `cdm.legalagreement` namespace has been renamed to `cdm.legaldocumentation`.
Created new namespace: `cdm.product.collateral`

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, download the CDM Distribution and see the updated namespaces.
