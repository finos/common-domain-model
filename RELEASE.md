# *Documentation: Process Model*

_What is being released_

Following recent overhaul of the Rosetta DSL documentation, the CDM documentation has been updated, focusing on:

* Process model section (formerly: functions)
* Product qualification section

The former CDM function section has been migrated to a dedicated Rosetta DSL function section (as per previous release), and the CDM documentation focuses instead on explaining how this function feature is used to standardise lifecycle event processes. Two types of process are being demonstrated:

* Validation process
* Calculation process
* An upcoming section (not part of this release) will also focus on event creation process

The product qualification section has also been adjusted to reflect the use of functions for the qualification logic.

Example snippets for the two updated sections have been updated to reflect their latest representation in the CDM, and some additional examples have been included where relevant.

_Review Direction_
