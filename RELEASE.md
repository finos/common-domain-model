# *CDM Model - Collateral Criteria AND/OR Logic*

_Background_

This release enhances the modelling of Eligible Collateral Criteria to enable the use of complex AND, OR and NOT logic in the combination of terms within a criteria.

Eligible Collateral is currently modelled using the data type `EligibleCollateralSpecification` which can contain many `EligibleCollateralCriteria`, which are themselves constructed from `CollateralTreatment`, `IssuerCriteria` and `AssetCriteria`.
The attributes `isIncluded` (true/false) and `qualifier` (all/any) can be used to model some simple cases of and / or logic in the construction of certain parts of the criteria (eg `AgencyRatingCriteria`).

Members of the CDM Collateral Working Group have requested that the functionality is extended to enable more complex combinations of AND and OR logic across multiple terms.  This has been implemented by combining all the criteria terms in a single new data type `CollateralCriteria`.  This is a choice data type that includes all the criteria terms that previously appeared in `AssetCriteria` and `IssuerCriteria`.  As each term can only occur once, in its simplest form, only one criteria can be specified.  If more than one criteria is required, it is necessary to specify whether the terms are all required or only that any of them are required.  The two new data types `AllCriteria` and `AnyCriteria` also appear on `CollateralCriteria` to enable this.  If all terms are required, ie AND logic, then the terms should be linked in a parent `AllCriteria`.  If any of the terms are required, ie OR logic, then the terms should be linked in a parent `AnyCriteria`.  These two terms can be used iteratively to create complex logic between terms.  Additionally, the data type `NegativeCriteria` can also be used in the logic to apply a NOT function to a single term.

_What is being released?_

This release implements AND, OR and NOT logic between the Collateral terms.

There is no longer a separate data type for each of asset and issuer criteria; they have been combined in a single new data type called `CollateralCriteria`.
- The new choice data type `CollateralCriteria` replaces the removed `AssetCriteria` and `IssuerCriteria` data types as the combined type.
- The attributes `issuer` and `asset` on `CollateralCriteriaBase` have now been replaced with the single one `collateralCriteria` which is the specific criteria that applies. It can be created using AND, OR and NOT logic, and both asset and issuer characteristics.
- The conditions on `CollateralCriteriaBase` have been updated and now use the new `CriteriaMatchesAssetType` function.
- The data type `ConcentrationLimit` has been refactored to reduce the cardinality of `concentrationLimitCriteria` to 1 and the condition is updated accordingly.
- The condition on `ConcentrationLimitCriteria` has been updated to reflect the combined `CollateralCriteria`.
- Three new logic data types have been introduced to support the AND, OR and NOT logic of terms and are used in `CollateralCriteria`:
  - `AllCriteria`
  - `AnyCriteria`
  - `NegativeCriteria`,
- The following new data types have been introduced and are used in `CollateralCriteria`:
  - `IssuerCountryOfOrigin`
  - `AssetCountryOfOrigin`
  - `IssuerName`
  - `IssuerAgencyRating`
  - `SovereignAgencyRating`
  - `AssetAgencyRating`
  - `AssetMaturity`
  - `ListingExchange`
  - `ListingSector`
  - `DomesticCurrencyIssued`.

Changes to remove the old model:
- The data types `AssetCriteria` and `IssuerCriteria` have been removed.
- The `qualifier` attribute has been removed from `AgencyRatingCriteria` as it is now redundant.
- The data type `ListingType` has been removed.

In addition, the following functions have also been updated to reflect the new modelling:
- `CheckEligibilityByDetails` which now references a new function `CheckCriteria` which takes a single criteria and evaluates it against the criteria. This function handles the recursive use of AND and OR logic.
- `CheckAssetCountryOfOrigin` has been made more generic as the country of origin can apply to both an Issuer and an Asset; it has been renamed to `CheckCountryOfOrigin`.
- `CheckMaturity` has been updated to reflect the new modelling of `AssetMaturity`.
- `CriteriaMatchesAssetType` has been implemented to enable the enforcement of conditions on AssetType to be evaluated correctly.

Previously, the function `Create_EligibleCollateralSpecificationFromInstruction` enabled some limited automation of the creation of multiple Criteria with slightly differing logic. As this function no longer aligns to the new design, it has been deleted.  The following new functions have been added in its place:

- `CloneEligibleCollateralWithChangedTreatment`:  Creates a new Eligible Collateral Specification based on an input specification but with one changed criteria with a changed treatment.
- `CreateAndCriteria`: Combines multiple `CollateralCriteria` together using AND logic.
- `CreateOrCriteria`: Combines multiple `CollateralCriteria` together using OR logic.

Some changes have been made to the Java supporting code behind this functionality; see the changes in the following files:
- rosetta-source/src/test/java/org/isda/cdm/functions/FunctionInputCreationTest.java
- rosetta-source/src/main/java/org/finos/cdm/CdmRuntimeModule.java
- rosetta-source/src/main/java/cdm/product/collateral/functions/MergeEligibleCollateralCriteriaImpl.java.

Finally, the CDM documentation has been updated to reflect all the above changes.

_Backward incompatible changes_

Most of these changes are not backward compatible as they remove or significantly alter data types and attributes.

The expectations have been regenerated.  In addition, the test files used for the Check Eligibility and Merge Critera functions have also been updated.

_Review Directions_

Please inspect the changes identified above for the functions and types in the Textual Viewer Rosetta.
