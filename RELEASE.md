_Review direction_

In the CDM Textual Browser:
- View download of CDM sources. Most files have only minor changes but there is a new Functions.daml

*Tutorials Page*

To aid users of CDM, a Tutorials page has been created, in which video tutorials will demonstrate the various ways to make use of CDM’s generated code artefacts. Initially, we have created a simple “Getting Started” video that shows how to access the ISDA CDM's generated code artefacts and setup the Maven project correctly in order to download all project dependencies. 

More tutorials will be uploaded in the coming weeks and as always, all feedback is welcome, please share them via the usual channels.

You can find the Tutorials Page on the CDM Portal’s Home Page.
