# _Infrastructure - Remove Unused Folders_

_What is being released?_

This release removes unused projects and folders to avoid the maintenance of legacy code.

The following folders have been removed:

- /rosetta-project - legacy Java PoC project related to translating CDM to FpML 
- /rosetta-source/src/main/resources/available-samples - folder contains samples that are duplicates of ingestion samples

_Review directions_
