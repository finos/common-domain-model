# *Bugfix Product Qualification Example & Minor Documentation Update*

_What is being released_

* Bugfix. Fixed the Qualification Java example to make use of the latest CDM Java APIs and additionally indicates where the qualification values should be stored on the CDM object. Added automated tests for several examples to catch code-level failures prior to releases. 
* Documentation Update. Clarification of record types were added to the Rosetta DSL documentation. 

_Review Directions_

* Bugfix. In the CDM Portal, in the Downloads section, download the CDM Java examples pack and inspect Qualification.java.
