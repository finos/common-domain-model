# _Product Model - Updates to Qualification of AssetClass_

_Background_

Some products are currently not covered by the "ISDA Taxonomy V2 Level 1 - ASSETCLASS" functions.
In particular, a gap in index underliers has been identified and is resolved by this update. For further information please see issue [#2762](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/2762).

_What is being released?_

This release modifies functions Qualify_AssetClass_* along the below three axes:

- Added inclusive checks on `underlier -> index -> productTaxonomy -> primaryAssetClass`
- Aligned security criteria to index criteria: switch from checking `security->securityType` to checking `security->productTaxonomy -> primaryAssetClass`
- Added inclusive checks on `forwardUnderlier` under some functions where only the `optionUnderlier` was previously considered

Modified functions:

- `Qualify_AssetClass_InterestRate`
- `Qualify_AssetClass_Credit` 
- `Qualify_AssetClass_ForeignExchange` 
- `Qualify_AssetClass_Equity` 
- `Qualify_AssetClass_Commodity`

# _Product Model - Cumulation Features_

_Background_

Some products may contain provisions upon which payout calculation and settlement apply to a core quantity that is incremented/cumulated over time. The cumulation feature is agnostic to the type of payout, as well as to the asset class involved, thus belongs to the quantity defined in the payout base of the product.
Besides, the cumulation rule may be either straight or involve more sophisticated features such as barriers or levers, as well as multiple cumulation periods to be taken into account when resolving the final multiplier to be applied to the core quantity.
However, it is assumed that the simple existence of cumulation feature per se, without any further details, is sufficient for defining the qualifiers required for Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR).

_What is being released?_

- Created new type `CumulationFeature` with no atttributes
- Listed the new type `CumulationFeature` as quantityCumulation attribute of type `ResolvablePriceQuantity` with cardinality (0..*)

# _Product Model - FpML Mappings - Contractual Party_

_Background_

Currently, `ContractualParty` is not being mapped in the `LegalAgreement` element. The `contractualParty` is a **(2..2) mandatory** element and should be represented accordingly to avoid validation failures. For more information see issue [#2788](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/2788) .

_What is being released?_

- Updated `DocumentationHelper` which allows mappers to extract the value from `TradableProduct->counterparty` and map it to `LegalAgreement->contractualParty`.
