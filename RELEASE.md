# _Product Model - Portfolio Return Terms_

_Background_

Some products may contain multiple individual return legs with a need to represent in the same trade:
- an aggregated view of the payout in which `underlier->basket` shall be defined, together with
- multiple return legs respectively `underlier->security` will also exist (that is a single underlier, mostly each being the same as the ones in `Basket->basketConsituent`).
That is notably the case when the portfolio return is of `priceReturn` type, usually in connection with a CFD-like business background. As an indication, other business cases may exist where the return at stake is of another kind, say `varianceReturn` or `volatilityReturn`, as part of dispersion strategy.
For the purpose of encompassing all the business cases, a new type, `PortfolioReturnTerms` is created, which mainly `extends ReturnTerms`, and is added as a new `PerformancePayout` attribute, with an open cardinality (0..*) : that is where to define the multiple individual returns; whereas the aggregated Basket level may exist at `PerformancePayout` level.
This also comes with other minor changes as further detailed below.

_What is being released?_

- Created new type `PorfolioReturnTerms` which `extends ReturnTerms` with existing types `PayerReceiver`
- Added new type `PorfolioReturnTerms` to `PerformancePayout`
- Added existing type `PriceSchedule` to `PerformancePayout` under three attribute names: `initialValuationPrice`, `interimValuationPrice` and `finalValuationPrice` (to replace current position in `ReturnTerms`, still in Prod for backward compatibility reasons, but will be `[deprecated]` at some point)
- Added new type `PorfolioBasketConsituent` to `Basket` (to enrich current type `Product`, but for backward compatibilty reasons, instead of modifying this type, a new one was created) which `extends Product` with existing types `PriceSchedule` under three attribute names, and `NonNegativeQuantitySchedule` for one, respectively: `initialValuationPrice`, `interimValuationPrice`, `finalValuationPrice` and `quantity`

# _Product Model - FpML Mapping - Commodity Forwards_

_What is being released?_

This release extends the FpML mapping coverage for Commodity Forwards.

- FpML `commoditySwap` legs `coalPhysicalLeg`, `electricityPhysicalLeg`, `environmentalPhysicalLeg`, `gasPhysicalLeg`, `oilPhysicalLeg` have been mapped into the model as a `ForwardPayout` leg
- The `payerPartyReference` and `receiverPartyReference` have been mapped to `ForwardPayout->payerReceiver`
- The `commodity->commodityClassification` reference has been mapped to `ForwardPayout->underlier->commodity->productTaxonomy`

# _Infrastructure - FpML 5.13 Ingestion Test Pack_

_What is being released?_

This release adds an ingestion test pack containing FpML 5.13 WD3 xml files from [www.fpml.org/spec/fpml-5-13-3-wd-3/](https://www.fpml.org/spec/fpml-5-13-3-wd-3/) examples download.

There are no changes to the model. Ingestion test expectations have been added for the new FpML 5.13 test pack.

# _Infrastructure - Dependency Update_

_What is being released?_

This release updates the `rosetta-dsl` dependencies.

Version updates include:
- `rosetta-dsl` 9.7.0: DSL validation and performance enhancements. For further details see DSL release notes: https://github.com/REGnosys/rosetta-dsl/releases/tag/9.7.0.

There are no changes to the model.  The number of expected ingestion validation failures has changed due to changes in the way validation failures are counted.
