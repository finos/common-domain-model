# *CDM Model - RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros Function*

_Background_

This release contains a new function for `RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros` function, as described in issue [#2915](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/2915#issuecomment-2393577467).

_What is being released?_

This release creates the new function `cdm.base.math.RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros` to not add any trailing 0's in the end if they do not already exist.

```
ffunc RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros: <"Round a number to the supplied precision, using the supplied rounding direction.">
    inputs:
        value number (1..1) <"The original (unrounded) number.">
        precision int (1..1) <"The number of decimal digits of precision.">
        roundingMode RoundingDirectionEnum (1..1) <"The method of rounding (up/down/nearest).">
    output:
        roundedValue number (1..1) <"The value to the desired precision">

    condition NonNegativePrecision: <"The number of decimal digits of precision should be greater than or equal to zero.">
        precision >= 0
```

The following examples show the function behaviour:
- `RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros(1023.123456789, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST, true)` = 1023.12346
- `RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros(1023.12000, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST, true)` = 1023.12
- `RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros(1023, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST, true)` = 1023
- `RoundToPrecisionRemoveTrailingZeros(999999999, 4, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST, true)` = 999999999

This would is new function, so there are no compatibility issues.

# *CDM Model - RoundToSignificantFigures Function*

_Background_

This release contains a new function for `RoundToSignificantFigures` function, as described in issue [#3154](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/3154).

_What is being released?_

This release creates the new function `cdm.base.math.RoundToSignificantFigures` to round to the significant number of decimal places.

```
func RoundToSignificantFigures: <"Round a number to the supplied significant figures, using the supplied rounding direction.">
    inputs:
        value number (1..1) <"The original (unrounded) number.">
        significantFigures int (1..1) <"The number of significant figures.">
        roundingMode RoundingDirectionEnum (1..1) <"The method of rounding (up/down/nearest).">
    output:
        roundedValue number (1..1) <"The value to the desired number of significant figures.">
        
    condition NonZeroSignificantFigures: <"The number of significant figures should be greater than zero.">
        significantFigures > 0
```

The following examples show the function behaviour:
- `RoundToSignificantFigures(1023.123456789, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST)` = 1023.1
- `RoundToSignificantFigures(1023.123456789, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> UP)` = 1023.2
- `RoundToSignificantFigures(1023.123456789, 5, RoundingDirectionEnum -> DOWN)` = 1023.1
- `RoundToSignificantFigures(1023.123456789, 1, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST)` = 1000
- `RoundToSignificantFigures(1023.1, 7, RoundingDirectionEnum -> NEAREST)` = 1023.1

This is a new function, so there are no compatibility issues.
