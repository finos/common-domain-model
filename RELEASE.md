# *Rename product qualification for Securities Lending and Repo*

_Background_

The current product qualification rules do not distinguish between securities lending and repurchase agreement product types.  A future enhancement will refactor how `product` works and also introduce additional capabilities to the qualification functions to use additional attributes to support finer grained qualification (see Issue #2365).

In the meantime, the current qualification rule for repurchase agreements - which is invoked also for securities lending products - will be renamed to be "SecuritiesFinancing" to more loosely differentiate both sets of products.

_What is being released?_

- An updated product qualification rule:  `Qualify_RepurchaseAgreement` is renamed to `Qualify_SecuritiesFinancing`.

_Data types_

No changes.

_Enumerations_

_Sample Files_
