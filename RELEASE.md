# *FpML Projection: Swaptions*

_What is being released_

Projection is the translation from CDM format to external data formats.  This release updates the FpML projection mappings for swaptions.  Note that to project a swaption into FpML, the input CDM data must qualify as `InterestRate_Option_Swaption`.

_Review Directions_

- In the Rosetta Core, open the Projection panel, and upload any of the CDM swaption json samples that are provided in the CDM distribution:

- `rates > ird-ex09-euro-swaption-explicit-physical-exercise`
- `rates > ird-ex09-euro-swaption-explicit-versioned`
- `rates > ird-ex10-euro-swaption-relative-usi`
- `rates > ird-ex12-euro-swaption-straddle-cash`
- `rates > ird-ex12-euro-swaption-straddle-cash-related-party`
