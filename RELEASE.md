This release updates the `rosetta-dsl` and `rosetta-bundle` dependencies:

- DSL `7.7.0`/ bundle 6.5.0: adds type format validation. Validation failures concerning type format (e.g., the number of characters in a string, the number of digits of a number) will now be displayed in the Report tab.

This release contains no changes to the model or test expectations.
