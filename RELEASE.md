# *Product Model - FpML mapping of Basic Price Return and Total Return Swaps*

_Background_

The `Payout` `performancePayout` was recently introduced to allow for representation of a wider variety of products, both new (Variance, Volatility, Correlation and Dividend Swaps) and already supported products (Basic Price Return and Total Return Swaps). In previous releases, the `PerformancePayout` was used to represent new products, and the deprecated `EquityPayout` was used to represent Basic Price and Total Return Swaps.

_What is being released?_

The FpML synonyms for Basic Price and Total Return Swaps have been moved from `EquityPayout` to `PerformancePayout`.

The following types and attributes have been updated:

- `ValuationDates` type added to the model
- `EquityValuationDates` type renamed as `PerformanceValuationDates`
- `PerformancePriceReturnTerms` type renamed as `PriceReturnTerms`
- `PerformanceDividendReturnTerms` type renamed as `DividendReturnTerms`
- `DividendPeriod->dividendPeriodStartDate` attribute renamed as `startDate`
- `DividendPeriod->dividendPeriodEndDate` attribute renamed as `endDate`
- Enum value `TradeDate`added to `DividendDateReferenceEnum`

The following qualification functions have been adapted for `PerformancePayout`:

- `Qualify_BaseProduct_EquitySwap`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_PriceReturnBasicPerformance_SingleName`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_TotalReturnBasicPerformance_SingleName`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_PriceReturnBasicPerformance_Index`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_TotalReturnBasicPerformance_Index`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_PriceReturnBasicPerformance_Basket`
- `Qualify_EquitySwap_TotalReturnBasicPerformance_Basket`
