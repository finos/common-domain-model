# *Event Model - Index Transition, Reset, Stock Split visualisation examples*

_What is being Released_

This release follows the recent work on the composable business event model and the corresponding creation function, `Create_BusinessEvent`. Visualisation examples have been created for Index Transition, Reset and Stock Split business events.

This release also removes deprecated types and functions from the old event model.  Some deprecated components from the old event model are still in use, mostly in ingestion examples, which will be migrated to the new event model and removed in future releases.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Instance Viewer, review the visualisation examples in the Index Transition Business Event and Stock Split Business Event folders.
