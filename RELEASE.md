# *User Documentation: Regulatory Reporting Syntax*

_What is being released_

A new section has been added to the Rosetta DSL documentation that explains the regulatory reporting components and the syntax that can be used to write reporting logic.

This update will allow external contributors to write further regulatory reporting components in the CDM, in order to scale-up the effort of digitising regulatory rules and associated best practices.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, navigate to the ISDA CDM Documentation tile and find the "Reporting Component" under the Rosetta DSL > Rosetta Modelling Components section.

Alternatively, documentation section is directly accessible at: https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/dsl/documentation.html#reporting-component.
