# *Technical Change - Update Python generation to utilize the new process*

## Background

The upcoming release of CDM 7 will standardize the serialization format (Issue #3236) and include a new Python library generated by updated tooling.

## What is being released?

The Python library will use updated tooling that supports metadata.  Python support for functions will arrive in a subsequent update.

Note that the new Python library for CDM 5.x will use the new serialization format that is not backward compatible with data produced by the old Python libraries.  Before standardization, cross-language data exchange (e.g., between Java and Python) was not guaranteed. The new Python tooling facilitates such compatibility by implementing the new format.

## Qualification and Validation - Fix use of empty in conditions and qualification functions

*Background*

An upcoming DSL release has found a number of areas where the use of `empty` in qualification functions and conditions was not being handled correctly. This change contains fixes that prepare the model for the upcoming DSL release.

*What is being released?*

The following functions have been updated:

- Qualify_Substitution
    - Check for existence of `beforeEconomicterms -> terminationDate` instead of the existence of `beforeEconomicterms`.
    - Check for existence of `openEconomicTerms -> effectiveDate` and `openEconomicTerms -> terminationDate` instead of the existence of `openEconomicTerms`.

- Qualify_Roll
    - Check for existence of `beforeEconomicterms -> collateral` instead of the existence of `beforeEconomicterms`.
    - Check for existence of `openEconomicTerms -> collateral` instead of the existence of `openEconomicTerms`.

- ExpirationTimeType
    - Make function only applicable when `expirationTime` and `expirationTimeType` are both present.

The following types have been updated:

- NonNegativeQuantitySchedule
    - Split condition `NonNegativeQuantity_value` into two conditions `NonNegativeQuantity_value` and `NonNegativeQuantity_datedValue`.

- ValuationMethod
    - Check for existence of `quotationAmount -> unit -> currency` instead of the existence of `quotationAmount`.
    - Check for existence of `minimumQuotationAmount -> unit -> currency` instead of the existence of `minimumQuotationAmount`.

- FixedPrice
    - Split condition `NonNegativePrice_amount` into two conditions `NonNegativePrice_amount` and `NonNegativePrice_datedValue`.
