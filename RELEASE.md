# *CDM Documentation*

_Background_

The CDM and its underlying technology (Rosetta) currently share the same documentation site. As the CDM and Rosetta mature, the documentation sites should be split to separate the concerns and have appropriate branding.

_What is being released?_

With this release, the [CDM documentation](https://cdm.docs.rosetta-technology.io) will move to its own dedicated site. The [Rosetta documentation](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io) will remain at the existing URL and will link to the CDM documentation.
