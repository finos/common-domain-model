# _Product Model - FpML synonym mappings of underlier for Equity Option Baskets_

_Background_

An issue was identified with the underlier mapping from FpML to CDM for Equity Option Basket products. The mapping from CDM was not generating an underlier and its corresponding baskets for these products and therefore some samples were not accurately qualified.

This release addresses this mapping issue, correctly generating the underlier and its corresponding baskets.

_What is being released?_

_Translate_

FpML synonym mappings added to populate CDM attribute `optionPayout -> underlier -> basket` with FpML path `equityOption -> underlyer -> basket` for Equity Option products with baskets.
