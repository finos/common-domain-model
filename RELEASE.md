# *Addition of WorkflowEventState and new ClearedTrade event qualification*

_What is being released_

The `isEvent ClearedTrade` definition has been update as part of the Clearing process in the CDM. It is now defined by the termination of a contract (alpha) and an execution and contract formation of the beta and gamma with a party role of `ClearingOrganisation`.

The new `WorkflowEventState` type is where the status of the clearing process will be held (i.e. Accepted, Rejected). The type `EventWorkflow` has been renamed to `WorkflowEventState` so that it is not confused with the `EventWorkflow` type.
