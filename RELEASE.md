# *Event Model - Removal of Legacy Event Model*

_Background_

This release follows the recent work on the composable business event model using Instructions and the corresponding creation function, Create_BusinessEvent. The previous approach using business events composed with primitive events was illustrated with several mocked up samples. Those were enabled with artificial XML schema and associated synonym mapping. They are no longer needed.

_What is being released?_

This release removes the final legacy component for the primitive based event model.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select Ingestion and review that the legacy primitive events have been removed
