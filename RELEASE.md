# *Model Change - Removed New Inline Comments*

_What is being released?_

This release removes inline comments (e.g. ones preceeded by TODO) that were introduced after the last clean up of inline comments.  There were eleven rows in the logical model from which these comments were removed.

_Review directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Textual Browser, search for any instances of //.  The only remaining ones should be as part of a URL or as a guidance comment in a function or synonyum.  Also there should not be any instances of /*.
