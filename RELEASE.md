# *CDM - A CDM user can access an extended FRO model*

_Background_

The ISDA Foundations project is a model extension built on top of the CDM that contains legal IP (contained in legal documentation references) only available to ISDA members. Additions or updates to the ISDA Foundations project can cause it to go out of sync with the CDM.

The issue [#3348](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/3348) proposes to migrate the ISDA Foundations project to the CDM, without the ISDA legal documentation IP

Preparation must be first be done in the CDM to synchronise it with the ISDA Foundations project and simplify the migration of any ISDA Foundations components.

_What is being released?_

As part of the preparation for the migration of any ISDA Foundations components to the CDM, this release creates an extended FRO Model in the CDM. This includes adding some (already sanitised) ISDA Foundations components into CDM, and moving other components around. 

1. Added extra attributes from `FloatingRateIndexDefinitionExtension` (and their required types) directly into `FloatingRateIndexDefinition`
2. Added extra attributes from `FloatingRateIndexCalculationDefaultsExtension` (and their required types) directly into `FloatingRateIndexCalculationDefaults`
3. Moved `ValidateFloatingRateIndexName` and `ValidateFloatingRateIndexTradeDate` to `observable.asset.fro`
4. Updated `ValidateFloatingRateIndexTradeDate` to call the existing `FloatingRateIndexMetadata` function iteratively.

_Backward-incompatible changes_

None.

# *CDM - Addition of changedCriteria to outputSpecification when using the CloneEligibleCollateralWithChangedTreatment function*

_Background_

The `CloneEligibleCollateralWithChangedTreatment` function creates a new Eligible Collateral Specification based on an input specification but with one changed criteria and one changed treatment.

Currently, when the function is invoked, the output of an `EligibleCollateralSpecification` only includes the `inputSpeciifcation` and the `changedTreatment`, but not the `changedCriteria`. This means that users can only change the treatment of a collateral item, but not a specific attribute.

_What is being released?_

This release sets an attribute of the `collateralCriteria` in the output to the `changedCriteria` specificied by the user when invoking the function.
