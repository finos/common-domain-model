# *Rosetta Syntax Upgrade: Migrate isProduct, isEvent and alias to use the func syntax*

_What is being released_

As part of on-going improvements, the Rosetta syntax has been upgraded to consolidate language features. This work aims to simplify the syntax needed when adding and editing the CDM.

* The Event Qualification logic is now expressed using the `func` syntax.
  The `isEvent` has now changed to use the standard `func` syntax. To differentiate this kind of function from others, it is annotated with `[qualification event]` and must always result in a `boolean`.

* The Product Qualification logic is now expressed using the `func` syntax.
  The `isProduct` has now changed to use the standard `func` syntax. To differentiate this kind of function from others, it is annotated with `[qualification product]` and must always result in a `boolean`.

* The `alias` syntax was previously used in two different ways, within functions and as a top-level element designed to be used in the `isEvent` and `isProduct` logic. The latter has now been expressed as a `func`.

_Review Directions_

In the Textual Browser, review func `InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis` for product qualification and `Allocation` for event qualification.  

The change for 'Allocation' expresses the same logic but defines the input and output types consistent with other parts of the model:

Previous syntax:
```
isEvent Allocation <"...">
    WorkflowEvent -> businessEvent -> primitives count = 1
    and WorkflowEvent -> businessEvent -> primitives -> allocation exists
```

Updated syntax:
```
func Allocation: <"...">
    [qualification event]
    inputs: workflowEvent WorkflowEvent(1..1)
    output: is_event boolean (1..1)
  
    assign-output is_event:
        workflowEvent -> businessEvent -> primitives count = 1
        and workflowEvent -> businessEvent -> primitives -> allocation exists

```

The change for `InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis` expresses the same logic but defines the input and output types consistent with other parts of the model:

Previous syntax:
```
isProduct InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis
    [synonym ISDA_Taxonomy_v1 value "InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis"]
    EconomicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> floatingRate count = 2
    and EconomicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> fixedRate is absent
    and EconomicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> inflationRate is absent
    and EconomicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> crossCurrencyTerms -> principalExchanges is absent
    and EconomicTerms -> payout -> optionPayout is absent
```
Updated syntax:
```
func InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis:
    [qualification product]
    inputs: economicTerms EconomicTerms (1..1)
    
    output: is_product boolean (1..1)
        [synonym ISDA_Taxonomy_v1 value "InterestRate_IRSwap_Basis"]
        
    assign-output is_product:
        economicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> floatingRate count = 2
        and economicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> fixedRate is absent
        and economicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> rateSpecification -> inflationRate is absent
        and economicTerms -> payout -> interestRatePayout -> crossCurrencyTerms -> principalExchanges is absent
        and economicTerms -> payout -> optionPayout is absent

```

The change for `forwardFX` alias also expresses the same logic but defines the input and output types consistent with other parts of the model:

Previous syntax:

```
alias forwardFX
    ForwardPayout -> underlier -> underlyingProduct -> foreignExchange
```
    
Updated syntax:

```
func ForwardFX:
    inputs:
        forwardPayout ForwardPayout(1..1)
    output: result ForeignExchange (1..1)
    assign-output result: forwardPayout -> underlier -> underlyingProduct -> foreignExchange
```
