# *Collateral Model - Check Eligibility Function*

_Background_

As part of the [FINOS BMO Hackathon](https://www.finos.org/hosted-events/2023-05-03-finos-hackathon-bmo-nyc) event in May 2023, a demonstation of a [use-case](https://github.com/finos/community/discussions/251) was created that showed the CDM can be used to check collateral eligibility against multiple jurisdictionsâ€™ minimum collateral requirements and specific eligible collateral schedules.

The demonstation was successful has been codified into the CDM and the `CheckEligibilityByDetails` function. 

_Model Changes_

- Added new function/types:
  - `CheckEligibilityByDetails` - Applys an `EligibilityQuery` to check against a set of given `EligibleCollateralSpecification` to determine which collateral meets the eligibility and can be used/posted for delivery.
