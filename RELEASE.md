# CDM Instance Viewer and Projection Tiles

_What is being released_

CDM Instance Viewer and Projection Tiles are now available in the CDM Portal.

The CDM Instance Viewer Tile visually represents CDM Event and CDM Event Sequences. Users drag-and-drop CDM JSON documents in to the UI, which generates the corresponding visual representation. The visualisation displays relationships between Events in a sequence and key CDM objects within each Event.

Projection Tile translates CDM Documents into FpML 5.10. Users again drag-and-drop CDM JSON documents in to the UI, which generates the FpML document. 

_Review Directions_

Users are invited to navigate to the CDM Portal where the above Tiles are available.
