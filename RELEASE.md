# *DSL Syntax - Remove deprecated DRR report syntax*

_What is being released?_

This release removes the deprecated DSL syntax to specify DRR reports using the `with fields` keywords. 

Review Directions

There is no impact as the usages have already been replaced in DRR by the `with type` keywords.
