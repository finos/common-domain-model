# *Product Model - Mapping to FpML: Addition of incomplete product examples*

_What is being released?_

This release includes additional FpML 5.10 data samples within the model where full synonym mapping has not been completed yet.  The new samples are included in an `fpml-5-10 -> incomplete-products` folder in order to identify them separately to samples in the `fpml-5-10 -> products` folder where CDM model components exist and synonym mappings have been created to support ingestion.  The addition of these examples gives transparency on further work required to support all products contained in the FpML 5.10 Confirmation View Examples download.
