# *Product Model - Principal Payments*

_Background_

This release refactors the data types and attributes used to specify Principal Payments in the CDM.

_What is being released?_

Data type `PrincipalExchanges` has been renamed `PrincipalPayments` and added to `PayoutBase` so that all Payouts that extend `PayoutBase` can describe Principal Payment features.  These features define whether intial, intermediate and final exchanges should occur, using a boolean attribute.  The timing, value and direction of initial and final payments.  And a schedule of intermediate payments.

A new attribute `principalPaymentSchedule` has been added to `PrincipalPayments` allowing the definition of initial and final principal payments, and a schedule of intermediate principal payments.

Data type `PrincipalExchange` has been renamed `PrincipalPayment` and refactored to explicitly define the direction of movement using a `payerReceiver` attribute, and the amount of principal to be paid, defined using the complex type `Money`.

The attribute `principalExchange` has been removed from data type `CashflowRepresentation`.
