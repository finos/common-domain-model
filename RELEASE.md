# *Documentation: DSL Documentation Overhaul*

_What is being released_

Complete overhaul of Rosetta DSL documentation, with the syntax now stabilised following a complete set of changes introduced recently.

The changes include:

* Change from ``class`` to ``type``
* Unification of validation components under ``condition`` attached to type
* All functions unified under ``func``, including object qualification logic
* New ``annotation`` concept introduced, to unify all metadata
* Syntax made more consistent across all these components

The examples illustrating the syntax in the documentation have been fully updated.
