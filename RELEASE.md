# Product Model - Interest Rate and Equity Qualification updates
_Background_

Currently, some FX Products are qualifying as Interest rate, Equity and FX. This is due to a minor issue with the Interest Rate and Equity Qualification Function.

_What is being released?_

This release includes a modification to the `Qualify_AssetClass_InterestRate` and `Qualify_AssetClass_Equity` logic to avoid qualifying FX Products as Interest Rate or Equity. 

_Review Directions_
