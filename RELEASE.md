# *Technical Change - Better expose CDM data validation issues to users*

_What is being released?_

Java code, which is used by the generated CDM Java code, has been updated to better expose validation issues. Technical CDM adopters will now more easily see data validation issues as they execute CDM data validation logic in a Java execution environment.

In the CDM Portal, navigate to the Downloads icon and then to the Java icon to download all Java code artefacts. Users can make use of the CDM Demo icon (also within Downloads) to see how to invoke CDM data validation logic in Java.
