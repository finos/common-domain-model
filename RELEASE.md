# _Mapping Update - Related party role mapper_

_Background_

The Party Role mapping issue involved the incorrect transfer of FpML's relatedParty structure into CDM, particularly in cases where multiple relatedParty elements exist within the same partyTradeInformation block. The mapping process was only capturing the first relatedParty role found, which led to incorrect associations between party references and roles. Furthermore, if the role of the first relatedParty was not found in PartyRoleEnum, another role was incorrectly assigned, causing mismatches and inaccuracies in the data mapping.


_What is being released?_

- We are introducing a new RelatedPartyRoleMappingProcessor that addresses the limitations of the previous implementation. This processor evaluates all relatedParty elements within a partyTradeInformation block instead of just mapping the first one. It ensures that each relatedParty is independently assessed, verifies its role against the PartyRoleEnum list, and assigns the correct role and reference accordingly. Additionally, if a role is not found in PartyRoleEnum, the processor omits that reference rather than assigning an incorrect role to the relatedParty.
