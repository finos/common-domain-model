# *Product Model - Quantity Change For Existing Trade Lot*

_Background_

This release adds support for price and/or quantity changes on an existing TradeLot, as described in issue [#2923](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/2923).

_What is being released?_

The `Create_QuantityChange` function has been updated to allow the price and/or quantity to be updated on an existing `TradeLot`. If the `QuantityChangeInstruction->lotIdentifier` matches the trade's `TradeLot->lotIdentifier`, then the price and/or quantity with matching units are updated based on the direction (i.e. `Increase`, `Decrease`, `Replace`) specified in the instructions.

The existing functionality is unchanged for an increase, i.e., if the `QuantityChangeInstruction->lotIdentifier` does not match the trade's `TradeLot->lotIdentifier`, then a new `TradeLot` is created.

_Review Directions_

In GitHub, review the following JSON sample files that have been added to represent the updates to an existing `TradeLot`.

- `cdm-sample-files/functions/business-event/quantity-change/increase-equity-swap-existing-trade-lot-func-input.json`
- `cdm-sample-files/functions/business-event/quantity-change/increase-equity-swap-existing-trade-lot-func-output.json`
- `cdm-sample-files/functions/business-event/quantity-change/partial-termination-equity-swap-func-input.json`
- `cdm-sample-files/functions/business-event/quantity-change/partial-termination-equity-swap-func-output.json`

In Rosetta, select the Visualisation tab and review the following examples in the Quantity Change Business Event folder:

- Increase Equity Swap with Existing Trade Lot
- Partial Termination Equity Swap
