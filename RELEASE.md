# *Product Model - Price Schedule*

_What is being released?_

This release updates the Price attribute in the PriceQuantity object to be specified as a schedule (optionally) instead of just a single value. That price schedule attribute can then be referenced in a consistent structure positioned in PayoutBase.

This release does not deal with remapping all the price attributes that are currently present in various payout structures - this will be part of future work.

_Background_

A review of the price and quantity attributes respectively in the `PriceQuantity` object (outside the `Payout`) and in the `ResolvablePayoutQuantity` (inside the `Payout`) identified some inconsistencies in how schedules were represented.

Previously, only a single point-in-time value was present in the `PriceQuantity` object for each price. This value was then referenced as a `Price` attribute in different payout structures depending on the type of payout (e.g. a `RateSchedule`, a `SpreadSchedule` etc.). In case the price was specified as a schedule, the single value in the `PriceQuantity` object represented the schedule's initial value while the rest of the schedule (date and value pairs) was directly specified in the payout-specific structure.

This release allows the `PriceQuantity` object to contain the entire schedule or just a single value for the price. It also adds a price schedule attribute to the generic `ResolvablePriceQuantity` structure (which supersedes `ResolvablePayoutQuantity`) positioned in `PayoutBase`. This structure now references the full price and quantity information (including schedule, if any) from the `PriceQuantity` object but does not store any actual value.

_Details_

The following data types and attributes have been modified:

- `PriceQuantity`: the `price` attribute is now specified as a `PriceSchedule`.
- `ResolvablePriceQuantity`: renamed from `ResolvablePayoutQuantity`
- `ResolvablePriceQuantity`: now contains a `priceSchedule` attribute with multiple cardinality. This attribute is associated to a `metadata address` notation to reference the `price` attribute in `PriceQuantity`.
- `RateSchedule`: removed the separate `initialValue` and `step` attributes and replaced with the single `priceSchedule` attribute, also associated to a `metadata address` notation. Several structure extend `RateSchedule` (e.g. `SpreadSchedule`, `StrikeSchedule`) and inherit that change.

Synonyms have been updated so that existing FpML price attributes (single value or entire schedule, if any) that mapped to `RateSchedule` or its extended data types continue to map to those. The `priceSchedule` attribute in `ResolvablePriceQuantity` is not being populated yet from any source document.

All the functional logic has been adjusted to reflect the changed type of the `price` attribute in `PriceQuantity`.
