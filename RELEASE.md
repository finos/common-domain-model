# *Mappings and model change - Simplify FpML Synonym Hierarchy*

_Background_

This release will simplify and rationalise the FpML synonym hierarchy and versions. This will make it easier for contributors working on synonyms to map FpML documents into CDM objects.

_What is being released?_

The following two mapping files are being renamed, with their paths remaining unchanged :

- `mapping-fpml-synonym.rosetta` to `mapping-fpml-confirmation-tradestate-synonym.rosetta`
- `mapping-fpml-process-synonym.rosetta` to `mapping-fpml-confirmation-workflowstep-synonym.rosetta`

The following synonym groups within these files are being renamed:

- `FpML_5_10_Processes` to `FpML_5_Confirmation_To_WorkflowStep`
- `FpML_5_10` to `FpML_5_Confirmation_To_TradeState`


All synonym groups related to specific versions such as `5.10`, `5.12` and `5.13` have been removed. The above groupings will now contain synonyms for all FpML 5 versions.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Textual Browser to inspect the synonym source groups mentioned above.
