# _Mapping Update - InterestRateForwardDebtPriceMappingProcessor updated to handle 'Percentage' quoteUnits_

_Background_

The price of bond forwards is captured as a monetary value whereas it should be a decimal/percentage. Even if the value in FpML was 'Percentage', the CDM representation value did not accurately represent this, causing misinterpretations.

_What is being released?_

- An update to the **InterestRateForwardDebtPriceMappingProcessor** code to fix the described issue. This change, would correct the interpretation by dividing the current monetary value by 100, when the *quoteUnits* corresponds to the XML value '*Percentage*'.
- The **bond-fwd-generic-ex01.xml** and **bond-fwd-generic-ex02.xml** samples have been updated as the files were using the value 'Percent' but the correct value according to the enum should be 'Percentage'

# _CDM Model - CapacityUnit Enum_

_Background_
In has been seen that in the ExternalUnitOfMeasure1Code from the 2Q2024 ISO External CodeSets v1, the unity Joule is supported in the Enum. However, in CDM this is not the case, as it does not appear anywhere in the CapacityUnitEnum. Therefore, the Joule unit of measure will be added to the CapacityUnitEnum for completeness and to align with 2Q2024 ISO External CodeSets v1, for versions 5 and 6 of CDM.

_What is being released?_

- Updated `CapacityUnitEnum` in cdm.base.math

_Enumerations_

- Updated `CapacityUnitEnum` by adding 'J' to support Joule unit
