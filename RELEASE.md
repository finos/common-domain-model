# _Collateral Enumerations - Updates to descriptions for ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum_

_Background_

It has been raised that there is some ambiguity with the attribute descriptions under the `ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum`. 
The word portfolio could mean several things; therefore, the CDM Collateral WG agreed to add the additional language across the descriptions to ensure it indicates the collateral schedule being listed in the collateral criteria and avoid misinterpretation.

_What is being released?_

Updates to descriptions for `ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum` listings to remove portfolio and replace with eligible collateral schedule where relevant and required

_Review Directions_

The changes can be reviewed in PR: [#4002](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/pull/4002)
