# *Legal Documentation & Collateral â€“ Eligible Collateral Schedule Builder Function*

_Background_

The current CDM model provides the unambiguous data representation of an Eligible Collateral Schedule, which necessarily requires a relatively verbose definition of complex data relationships.

When using the CDM Object Builder to manually construct an Eligible Collateral Schedule members need a quicker method for creating more complex Eligible Collateral Schedule information.

The existing Eligible Collateral Schedule data type should not be changed as it has been tested and signed off by members as suitable for representing an unambiguous complete schedule.

_What is being released?_

Function `EligibleCollateralScheduleHelper` has been added to provide a quicker way to build an `EligibleCollateralSchedule` through the combination of common and variable schedule characteristics.  The function input `EligibleCollateralScheduleInstruction` contains common and variable `EligibleCollateralCriteria` which are merged by the function to form a complete `EligibleCollateralSchedule`.
