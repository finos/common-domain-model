# *Updates to Zero Coupon Swaps Qualification Functions*

_Background:_
- The Qualification functions in CDM classify financial products.
- The goal of this update is to improve the existing qualifying functions `Qualify_InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` and `Qualify_InterestRate_InflationSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon`.
- Qualifying functions `Qualify_InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` and `Qualify_InterestRate_InflationSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` don't need the reference to `Qualify_Transaction_ZeroCoupon_KnownAmount` since it is redundant. The first two functions use `Qualify_Transaction_ZeroCoupon` and that means that the reference to the `KnownAmount` function is not needed.


_What is being released?_

- Updated the `Qualify_InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` and `Qualify_InterestRate_InflationSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` functions. Removed the OR statement checking the applicability of `Qualify_Transaction_ZeroCoupon_KnownAmount` in both functions.

- Corrected one of the `InterestRatePayout` type conditions. Updated the `RateSpecification` condition to check the presence of `priceQuantity` instead of `principalPayment`.

       
_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Textual Browser and inspect the `Qualify_InterestRate_IRSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` and `Qualify_InterestRate_InflationSwap_FixedFloat_ZeroCoupon` functions, and the `InterestRatePayout` type.

# *Event Model - PartyRoleEnum including PTRRServiceProvider role*

_Background_

In order to report under EMIR, a party needs to be identified as a portfolio compression or a portfolio rebalancing service provider. These roles can be unified in a more generic role: PTRR Service Provider. The current CompressionServiceProvider code will be replaced by PTRRServiceProvider.

_What is being released?_

- CDM enum `PartyRoleEnum` has been modified in the following way: code `CompressionServiceProvider` has been marked as `[deprecated]` and a more generic code `PTRRServiceProvider` has been added.
- Synonym mappings have been added to populate the `PartyRoleEnum` with `PTRRServiceProvider` whenever the FpML is populated with `PTRRCompressionProvider` or `PTRRRebalancingProvider`
