# _CDM Model - Addition of Exchange attributes_

_Background_

In accordance with the CDM roadmap, the model is being expanded and updated to ensure robust support for evolving regulatory requirements. Specifically, for a new reporting rule called _Underlying Asset Trading Platform Identifier_. This reporting rule requires extracting the platform on which the underlying asset is traded, thus this information is given by `exchange` and `relatedExchange` attributes. Since this reporting rule is needed in DRR 6, which operates using CDM 5, we need to add these attributes in CDM 5.

_What is being released?_

This release includes the addition of the attributes `exchange` and `relatedExchange` in the following types:
- `Commodity`
- `Security`

To achieve this, an intermediate type called `Listing` is created to prevent contamination in other types and to maintain consistency with CDM 6. The rationale behind this change is that a new field requires extracting the platform on which the underlying asset is traded which is given by `exchange` and `relatedExchange` attributes. The discussion on this matter can be found in issue [#3338](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/issues/3338).
