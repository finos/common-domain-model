# *User Documentation - Development Guidelines*

_What is being released_

This release consolidates all the development guidelines into a single section in the CDM user documentation, and adds a specific sub-section regarding the agile development approach. It also includes some minor fixes and clean-ups.

In the CDM user documentation, there is now an entire section called "Development Guidelines". This section contains the following sub-sections:

- Governance (previously part of the "Overview" section)
- Design Principles (previously part of the "Overview" section)
- Agile Development Approach (new sub-section)
- How to Contribute (was previously a stand-alone section)
- Documentation Style Guide (was previously a stand-alone section)

In the "Overview" section, the governance and design principles parts have been replaced by references with links to that new "Development Guidelines" section of the user documentation.

_Review Directions_
