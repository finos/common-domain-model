# *Technical Change - Bugfix to Graphical Navigator in CDM Portal*

_What is being released?_

Bugfix. The Graphical Navigator in the CDM Portal was broken such that it failed to show type details in the right panel. The same bug also broke the search functionality.

_Review directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Graphical Navigator, search for a data type, e.g. TradableProduct, observe the graphical display of this data type and the type details in the right panel.
