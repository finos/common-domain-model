# _Mapping Updates - KnownAmountSchedule Mappings_

_Background_

The `PriceQuantity>priceSchedule` component is not represented in the InterestRatePayout when we have a sample with `knownAmountSchedule`. This release updates the mappings so that knownAmountSchedule is mapped to the `priceSchedule` component.

_What is being released?_

- Updated mappings for `PriceSchedule` to FpML `knownAmountSchedule`.
