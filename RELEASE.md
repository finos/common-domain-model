# *DSL Syntax - Digital Regulatory Reporting Report Definition*

_What is being released?_

This release contains DSL change to allow Digital Regulatory Reporting syntax to specify the `report` as a `type` where each attribute is associated with a `regulatory rule`, rather than a simple list of `fields` (e.g. `regulatory rule` list).

_Details_

Specifying the `report` as a `type` allows the cardinality and type to be specified and validated for each report attribute.  Furthermore, the API report output is now structured to allow transformation into other data formats (e.g. ISO 20022) possible.

_Review Directions_

Changes to report syntax will be made in an upcoming Digital Regulatory Reporting release.
