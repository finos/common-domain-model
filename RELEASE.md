# Product Qualification - Modification to Interest Rate and Equity Qualification function
_Background_

Currently, some FX Products are qualifying as Interest rate, Equity and FX. This is due to a minor issue with Interest Rate and Equity Qualification Function.

_What is being released?_

Modification to Qualify_AssetClass_InterestRate and Qualify_AssetClass_Equity to avoid qualifying FX Products as Interest Rate or Equity.
