# Change in rosetta path conditional mapping* 
 
_What is being released_ 
 
A slight change to the semantics of the rosetta path conditional logic to make it more consistent required a 
minor change to the synonyms for 'effectiveDate' in 'calculationPeriodDates'

_Review Directions_ 
 
In Portal run ingestion and verify that effective dates are still being mapped correctly
