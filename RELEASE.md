_What is being released_

New code generator that projects the CDM into Scala.
- Scala code generated for all CDM types and enums.
- JSON serializer / deserializer provided in Scala distribution.  
- Interoperability with other generated CDM code - E.g. serialized CDM Scala artefacts are identical to serialized Java CDM artefacts.
- Injected into CDM build pipeline so all new CDM releases will include Scala code artefacts.
- Scala download tile added to the ISDA CDM Portal Downloads page.

- In the CDM Portal, go to Downloads section and download Scala distribution.
