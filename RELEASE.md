# *User Documentation - Add Design Principles section*

_What is being released?_

The CDM design priciples have been documented as part of the CDM overview section of the user documentation. They describe the driving principles of the CDM design at a high-level, providing some direct examples from the model to illustrate practical applications of those principles.

Laying-out the design principles in the documentation will facilitate contributions to the CDM by the community, and help users understand the rationale behind some of the CDM design choices. The How to Contribute guide has been adjusted to refer to the design principles documentation.
