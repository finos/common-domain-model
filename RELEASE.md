# *Infrastructure - Dependency Update*

_What is being released?_

This release updates the `rosetta-dsl` dependency.

Version updates include:
- `rosetta-dsl` 8.8.1: Changes to support serialisation to XML. For further details see DSL release notes: https://github.com/REGnosys/rosetta-dsl/releases/tag/8.8.1.

There are no changes to the model, so the test expectations remain the same.

The changes can be reviewed in PR [#2430](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model/pull/2430).
