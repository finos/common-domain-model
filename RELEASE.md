# *Legal Agreement Model - ISDA Create mappings*

_What is being released_

This release moves the `ISDA_Create_1_0` synonym mappings into a separate file, `synonym-cdm-isda-create.rosetta`.  Separating the model and synonym mappings improves readability and maintenance, and is consistent with other mappings, such as `FpML_5_10`.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Textual Browser and search for the `ISDA_Create_1_0` synonyms.
