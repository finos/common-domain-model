# *Model Optimisation: Initial fees and additional payments*

_What is being released_

The `Create_Execution` function has been modified to include an input for the initial settlement information for the transaction such as a fee or upfront payment. 

The existing `SettlementTerms` type has been used for this and has been adjusted to contain all relevant information: date, parties, and payer/receiver, plus an assetIdentifier to uniquely link this cashflow settlement to a cashPrice specification.
