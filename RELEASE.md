# *Technical Change - Update Python generation to utilize the new process*

## Background

The upcoming release of CDM 7 will standardize the serialization format (Issue #3236) and include a new Python library generated by updated tooling.

## What is being released?

The Python library will use updated tooling that supports metadata.  Python support for functions will arrive in a subsequent update.

Note that the new Python library for CDM 5.x will use the new serialization format that is not backward compatible with data produced by the old Python libraries.  Before standardization, cross-language data exchange (e.g., between Java and Python) was not guaranteed. The new Python tooling facilitates such compatibility by implementing the new format.
