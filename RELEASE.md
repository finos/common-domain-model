# *Concentration Limit â€“ Refactor value and percentage cap. Addition of concentration limit type (Issue Outstanding Amount)*

_What is being released?_

The data type `ConcentrationLimit` has various attributes to define a concentration limit by criteria but also provides a means for how to express the concentration limit as a number value or a percentage.  The corresponding data attributes `valueCap` and `percentageCap` only allowed for expression of a higher limit (cap). These have been renamed and refactored to `valueLimit` and `percentageLimit` and will now allow the user to express both an upper and lower limit (cap and floor) as a number value or percentage.

In addition to this, data attribute `ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum`, an additional option has been added to the enumeration list to specify `IssueOutstandingAmount` The user can now express concentration limits on an assets outstanding amount issued on the market.
