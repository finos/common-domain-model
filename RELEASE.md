# *Infrastructure: Add Ingestion Environment for ORE XML model*

_What is being released_

A new synonym source `ORE_1_0_39` has been created in the CDM which is being used to create mappings between the ORE XML model and the CDM. The initial scope for the mapping is plain vanilla interest rate swaps.

A new Ingestion Envrionment has also been added such that ORE XML sample documents and their ingested CDM representations can be displayed in the CDM Portal.  

_Review Directions_
In the Rosetta core, see the filename synonyms-cdm-ore

In the Ingestion page, see the drop-down for the `ore-1-0-39` entry.
