# *CDM Model: Namespace Changes (Base Package)*

_What is being released_

Rosetta CDM Model is being refactored into namespaces to make it more modular. This will enable the users of CDM to import only 
the part of the model they are interested in. 

This refactor is the first of many incremental changes that will transform the CDM into hierarchical namespace tree. The first refactor is 
for the __base.cdm.*__ package.
