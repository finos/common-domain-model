# _Infrastructure - update Java version to 21_

_What is being released?_

The project now builds using `Java 21` for improved tooling, performance, and developer experience.

_Backwards Compatability

Despite the upgrade to `Java 21`, while the `--release flag` is set to `Java 11`. This ensures continued compatibility with environments running Java 11 and above. This means the `implementor` will `not` be required to change their Java Version, it will work same as before.

_Review directions_
