# *Event Model: Function test changes based on working group feedback*

_What is being released_

Follow up action from 12-May-20 Design WG minutes:

Demonstration was provided of the Create, Correct, Cancel function:

> Working group observed that rejected is including in the cancel WorkflowStep. This should be removed from the model. Action: CDM team to review attributes contained within type WorkflowStep and revise accordingly.

The reject has been removed from the cancel step.

Demonstration of Create_ContractFormation with a Legal Document:

> Working group observed that under Contract, the parties are defined twice. Firstly, as parties to the Contract, and secondly as parties to the Legal Agreement. Response: CDM team will review how parties are referenced through this function and recommend an approach that doesnâ€™t require parties to be defined in multiple places.

The parties within the legel agreement are now references to the parties defined in the contract to avoid duplicating parties.

_Review Direction_

In the Instance Viewer section of the CDM Portal:

- See "New Cancel Correct" section. Observe that in the visualisation, the cancel is no longer rejected.
- Under the "Form Contract" section, open "Fixed/Floating Single Currency Interest Rate Swap With Legal Agreement" and observe that in the parties are not duplicated in the `LegalAgreement`.
