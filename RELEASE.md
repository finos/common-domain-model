# *Product Model - New Performance Payout*

_Background_

This change addresses the gap in the CDM product model for representing variance, volatility, correlation, and dividend swaps. The model avoids the proliferation of new payouts with one central new Performance Payout to cover these type of swaps as well other products previously represented with the use of the Equity Payout (e.g price and total return swaps). The singular Performance Payout specifies a specific metric observed and the function applied by the means of different return terms, each of them featuring both shared and return-terms-endemic components. The corresponding  structural definition covers all products sharing the following characteristics:
* Require the observation of an underlier to be made.
* The return is derived from the observed value of the underlier, either directly (as in price or total return swaps) or by applying a specific function to the observed value (as in variance, volatility, or correlation).

The new performance payout is not equity-exclusive. It cover other performance based products such as foreign exchange variance and volatility swaps, belonging to the Foreign Exchange asset class.

Given the complexity of the change, the previous equity payout has been temporarily maitained along with the new performance payout. All components affected by the change have been duplicated to allow the user to represent equity products either ways (except for the new variance, volatility and correlation, which were not included in the equity payout).

As this coexistence of both equity and performance payouts is devised as a temporary measure until the latter is fully tested, components associated with the older model have been marked as deprecated.

Change summary:
  
* New performance payout, intended to:
  * Substitute the equity payout (price, total return products)
  * Represent variance, volatility, correlation and partially dividend 
* Added specific components for variance, volatility, correlation and dividend products.
* Renamed FixedForwardPayout to FixedPricePayout to better reflect its content and usage.
* Restructured date system for equity products. The attribute calculationPeriodDates replaced by valuationDates and observationDates for all performance products.
* Duplicated components to allow the coexistence of old and new representation of equity products (equityPayout/performancePayout and calculationPeriodDates/valuationDates and observationDates).

_What is being released?_

The summary below is divided into sections for Data Types, Enumerations, Functions and Translate.

*Data Types*

`event-common-type`:

Modified

* `SettlementOrigin` – Added performancePayout. fixedForwardPayout replaced by fixedPricePayout.
* `Lineage` – References to equityPayout deprecated. Equivalent references to performancePayoutAdded

`observable-asset-type`:

New

* `EquityValuationDates` – With respect to EquityValuation, removed price attribute.
* `EquityObservation` –  Defines how and when a performance type option or performance type swap is to be observed. Structure analogous to that of EquityValuation.
* `DividendApplicability` – The parameters which define whether dividends are applicable. Equivalent to the FpML Dividends.model.

Deprecated

* `EquityValuation`

`product-asset-type`:

New

* `PerformanceDividendReturnTerms` –  Several components removed because they are represented in dividendReturnTerms -> dividendPeriod. Added attribute performance as a placeholder.
* `DividendPeriod` – Time bounded dividend payment periods, each with a dividend payment date per period.
* `PerformancePriceReturnTerms` – valuationPriceInterim replaced by valuationPriceInitial. Absorbed returnType to distinguish if the payout is part of a total return product, or it is price only.  Absorbed elements formerly exclusive to commodity return terms (no longer present in the performance payout), but potentially applicable to equity products as well (rounding, conversionFactor, spread, rollFeature). Added attribute performance as a placeholder.
* `ReturnTermsBase` – Contains all common components in variance, volatility and correlation return Terms.
* `VarianceReturnTerms`  – Contains all specific components required to represent a variance product and, through inheritance from ReturnTermsBase, those common to variance, volatility and correlation.
* `VolatilityReturnTerms` – Contains all specific components required to represent a volatility product and, through inheritance from ReturnTermsBase, those common to variance, volatility and correlation.
* `CorrelationReturnTerms` – Contains all specific components required to represent a correlation product and, through inheritance from ReturnTermsBase, those common to variance, volatility and correlation.
* `Valuation` – Contains all non-date valuation information.
* `EquityUnderlierProvisions`  – Contains Equity underlier provisions regarding jurisdiction and fallbacks.
* `VarianceCapFloor`  – Contains possible barriers for variance products, both variance-based and underlier price based.

* `VolatilityCapFloor` – Contains containing volatility-based barriers.
* `BoundedCorrelation` –  Describes correlation bounds, which form a cap and a floor on the realized correlation.

Deprecated
