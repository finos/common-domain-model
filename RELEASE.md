# *Legal Documentation - Addition of clause Holding and Using Posted Collateral*

_Background_

D2 Legal Technology and ISDA are updating legacy clause definitions within the model related to collateral, notices, and specified conditions under the ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA) framework.

These clauses are foundational to collateral mechanics and counterparty obligations under the CSA, and are being modernised to align with prevailing legal interpretations and documentation standards.

This contribution of the clause for Holding and Using Posted Collateral enhances the model and contributes a structure for the following Legacy CSAs - ISDA 1995 English Law CSA, 1994 New York Law CSA, 1995 English Law CSD

_What is being released?_

Contribution of the last pending clause for the Legacy ISDA CSA/CSD Documents from the Legal Agreement Working Group.

- `EligibilityToHoldCollateral`
  - Restructuring the EligibilityToHoldCollateral type to more accurately represent the document and allow for criteria to be grouped using AND/OR logic.
