# *Infrastructure - Dependency Updates*

_What is being released?_

This release updates the `rosetta-dsl` dependency:

- `7.7.3`: Adds type format validation. Validation failures concerning type format (e.g., the number of characters in a string, the number of digits of a number) will now be generated by the DSL.

This release contains no changes to the model or test expectations.

_Review directions_

CDM Java implementors should update their maven `pom.xml` to the latest CDM maven artefact (groupId com.isda, artifactId cdm) and recompile.
