# _Product Model - ISO Country Code Enum Update_

_Background_

Rosetta has a feature for its enumerations that enables, if a certain enumeration is directly related to an FpML or ISO coding scheme, to label that enumeration with the corresponding coding scheme canonical URI, so every time that coding scheme is updated, the enumeration will be automatically updated.

_What is being released?_

This release updates `ISOCurrencyCodeEnum` to keep it in sync with the latest ISO 4217 coding scheme.

* Removed enum value `SLL <"Leone">`
