# *Infrastructure - Java 8 Support*

_What is being released?_

To provide a wider compatibility for CDM Java implementors, this release changes the Java version of the distributed CDM Java artefacts from version 11 to 8.

_Review Directions_

CDM Java implementors should update their maven `pom.xml` to the latest CDM maven artefact (groupId `com.isda`, artifactId `cdm`) and recompile with Java 8 (or later).
