# _Event Model - TradeState Quantity Decrease update_

_Background_

The `QuantityDecreasedToZero` function currently assumes that a decrease has occurred when the quantity is reduced to zero by checking that:

1. The quantity in the after TradeState is zero.
2. The quantity in the before TradeState is zero or greater.

This leads to incorrectly flagging as decreases the cases where both the `before` and `after` quantities are zero, which should not be considered decreases.

_What is being released?_

This contribution modifies the logic in the `QuantityDecreasedToZero` function so that a decrease is only considered when the before quantity is greater than zero, not equal to zero.

# _Infrastructure - Dependency Update_

_What is being released?_

This release updates the `DSL` and `Guice` dependencies.

Java projects that depend on the generated Java code of the Common Domain Model - the `cdm-java` artifact - are advised to replace all references to the `javax.inject` package with `jakarta.inject`. Support for the `javax.inject` package will be dropped in a future major version. See the Google Guice docs for more information about this package migration: https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Guice700#jee-jakarta-transition

This release upgrades the project to compile and run using `Java 21`, taking advantage of the latest improvements in the Java platform, including enhanced performance and security updates.

Version updates include:
- Guice 6.0.0: adds support for the `jakarta.inject` namespace in favour of `javax.inject`.
- DSL 9.48.0: errors occuring during code generation are now underlined in red. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.48.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.48.0)
- DSL 9.48.1: fix for conditions on type aliases. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.48.1](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.48.1)
- DSL 9.49.0: no relevant changes for the CDM. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.49.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.49.0)
- DSL 9.49.1: no relevant changes for the CDM. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.49.1](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.49.1)
- DSL 9.50.0: infrastructure update for Xtext 2.38.0. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.50.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.50.0)
- DSL 9.50.1: no relevant changes for the CDM. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.50.1](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.50.1)
- DSL 9.51.0: no relevant changes for the CDM. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.51.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.51.0)
- DSL 9.52.0: fixes an issue where overriding multicardinality attributes breaks Java code generation. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.52.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.52.0)
- DSL 9.52.1: fixes deserialization of overridden attributes. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.52.1](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.52.1)
- DSL 9.53.0: no relevant changes for the CDM. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.53.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.53.0)
- DSL 9.53.1: fixes related to the `sort`, `max` and `min` operations, and disallows invalid usage of enum types in expressions. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.53.1](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.53.1)
- DSL 9.54.0: upgrades the DSL to Java 21. See DSL release notes: [DSL 9.54.0](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/releases/tag/9.54.0)

This release also updates `BusinessCenterEnum` and `FloatingRateIndexEnum` to keep it in sync with their latest coding schemes.

_Backward Compatibility_

While the project compiles using `Java 21`, the distributed `cdm-java` artifact remains compatible with `Java 8`. This ensures backward compatibility with `Java 8` (and later) runtime environments.

- CDM contributors need `Java 21` installed locally to build or contribute to the project
- CDM implementors do not need to upgrade as the runtime compatibility remains at `Java 8`

_Review Directions_

There are no changes to the test expectations.
