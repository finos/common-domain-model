# _CDM Model - Date Time Functions_

_What is being released?_

This release implements the existing `ToDateTime` function, and adds `ToTime` function.

- `ToDateTime` - converts a `date` to a `zonedDateTime`, defaulting the `time` to "00:00:00" and the `timezone` to "Z" (UTC) 
- `ToTime` - created a `time` from inputs of `hours`, `minutes` and `seconds`

_Review directions_

In Rosetta, select the `Common Domain Model` project, then select the Textual Browser and inspect the functions `ToDateTime` and `ToTime`.
