# *Infrastructure - Java 8 Support*

_What is being released?_

To provide a wider compatibility for CDM implementors, this release changes the Java version of the distributed CDM Java artefacts from version 11 to 8.  

_Review Directions_

CDM maven artefacts `com.isda.cdm`, and dependencies `com.regnosys.rosetta-common` and `com.regnosys.rosetta.lib` can now be used in Java 8 environments.
