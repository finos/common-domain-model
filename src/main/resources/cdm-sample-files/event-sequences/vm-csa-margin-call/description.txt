An example of a Margin Call that resulted from a Variation Margin calculation. The input to the example is a single FX Forward New Trade Event. The subsequent Reset (soon to be renamed something more appropriate) and Payment events are to be generated by software implementation. The assumptions of this example is that the VM CSA document already exists and is referenced in the Fx Forward New Trade Event.
