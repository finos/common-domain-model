In this event sequence we demonstrate how a new Equity Swap Contract Event, an Equity Performance Calculation Event and a Cash Payment Event should be represented. The example makes use of CDM Function Specifications as well as their corresponding Implementations to correctly construct the sequence of events.

The sequence uses an FpML Equity Swap Confirmation message as its input. Then the Product, Parties and Equity Master Confirmation Agreement are extracted from this confirmation. These objects are then used in the execution of Function Implementations that correctly construct the sequence of events.

The event sequence consists of a New Contract Event, followed by an Equity Performance Calculation Event (currently named Reset Event) and then a Payment Event. Invoke each function in order to see the graphical visualisation of Events update.
