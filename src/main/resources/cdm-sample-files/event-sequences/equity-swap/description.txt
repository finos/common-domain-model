In this event sequence we demonstrate how a new Equity Swap Contract Event, an Equity Performance Calculation Event and a Cash Payment Event should be represented. The example makes use of CDM Function Specifications as well as their corresponding Implementations to correctly construct the sequence of events.

To run the sequence, scroll to down and click the "Invoke Function" button. To see the whole sequence, just keep clicking!

The sequence uses an FpML Equity Swap Confirmation message as its input. The Product, Parties and Equity Master Confirmation Agreement are extracted from this confirmation and represented in the Sequence Data section below.

These objects are then used in the execution of Function Implementations that correctly construct the sequence of events. Note that the Global Keys (marked in parenthesis) next to each Function Input can be found in the Sequence Data section.

The event sequence consists of a New Contract Event, followed by an Equity Performance Calculation Event (currently named Reset Event) and then a Payment Event. Invoke each function in order to see the graphical visualisation of Events update.
