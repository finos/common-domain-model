FpML 5.0 - Readme file
===========================================

There are two sets of documentation for each view published in FpML:
* confirmation - contains the confirmation view of FpML
* reporting - contains the reporting view of FpML


For each of these views, there are schema files and example subddirectories.


Confirmation Schemas:

The schema files are labelled fpml-XXX-5-0.xsd, as follows:
	* example-extension-5-0.xsd - File containing an example of an extension from the 5.0 confirmation view schemas.

Plus, each view directory contains subdirectories for each group of FpML examples, namely:

confirmation/business-processes/
 * allocation
 * clearing
 * confirmation
 * consent
 * execution-advice
 * execution-notification
 * trade-change-advice

confirmation/products/
 * bond-options
 * commodity-derivatives
 * credit-derivatives
 * correlation-swaps
 * dividend-swaps
 * equit-forwards
 * equity-options
 * equity-swaps
 * inflation-swaps
 * interest-rate-derivatives
 * total-return-swaps
 * variance-swaps

reporting/
 * cash flow matching
 * credit-event-notice
 * entity-reporting
 * portfolio-reconciliation
 * position-and-activity-reporting
 * reset-reporting
 * valuation



Each subdirectory contains a number of example files.  These files are named as follows:
YY_exNN_long_description.xml, 
where
YY is the subset identifier and
NN is an integer number.

The examples have a schemaLocation attribute that references their parent 
directory.  In other words, the FpML schema must be present in the parent 
directory of the example file for the example file to validate using the 
schemaLocation attribute.

The schemaLocation attribute previously referenced the examples' own directory, 
and extra copies of the schema files were placed in each example directory.
This simplified validation of the examples and helped certain tools to work
properly, but caused some users confusion.

The examples have been validated using Xerces J v 2.4.1.
