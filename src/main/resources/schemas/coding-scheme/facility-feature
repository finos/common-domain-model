            <SimpleValue>A Credit Facility pursuant to which Lenders make Bridge Loans which are short-term loans (generally maturing in one year) that typically (although not always) are not intended to be funded.

Traditionally, Bridge Loans are used by Financial Buyers (Sponsors) in auction situations, but corporate buyers also sometimes use Bridge Loans to finance acquisitions.  </SimpleValue>

            <SimpleValue>An unsecured debt instrument with certain equity-like characteristics.  The Mezzanine component of a capital structure is subordinate in right of payment to Senior Debt and carries a coupon similar to high yield bonds. Mezzanine debt is often issued at the holdco level. Mezzanine debt often has equity features, frequently referred to as equity kickers, which may take the form of warrants that permit the holder to purchase equity at a preset price, or conversion features upon certain events (such as change of control). The combination of the debt coupon and the equity kicker gives Mezzanine investors a higher return than high yield bonds. </SimpleValue>

         <Value>
            <SimpleValue>An interest rate feature that gives the Borrower the option to pay all, half or none of the interest for any period (generally during a non-call period) in kind. Typically, an interest rate step up will apply to any portion of interest that is paid in kind. PIK Toggles are attractive to Borrowers because of the ability to "toggle" out of cash interest payments in times of a liquidity crunch - meaning if the Borrower is short on cash, it can stop making cash interest payments and just let the interest PIK.</SimpleValue>
