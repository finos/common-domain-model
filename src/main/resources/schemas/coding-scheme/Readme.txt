A number of data elements defined in FpML are restricted to holding one of a limited set of possible values, e.g. currency, business centers, etc. Such restricted sets of values are frequently referred to as domains.

Domains in FpML that are expected to change over time are coded using a strategy that has been defined by the Architecture Working Group, referred to as 'Coding Schemes'. 

Each Coding Scheme is associated with a URI. Coding Schemes can be categorized as one of the following:

* An external coding Scheme, which has a well-known URI. In this case the URI is assigned by an external body, and may or may not have its own versioning, date syntax and semantics.
 
* An external coding Scheme, which does not have a well-known URI. In this case FpML assigns a URI as a proxy to refer to the concept of the external Scheme.  URI will not be versioned.

* An FpML-defined coding Scheme. In this case the Scheme is fully under FpML control and the URI will change reflecting newer versions and revisions as the scheme evolves and changes.

A coding scheme provides alternate identifiers for one identity. It is not used to identify things other than the identity of the thing that contains it.


The "codelist.zip" file contains the following coding Scheme XML files:

External Schemes (represented in Specification, not in XML)
===========================================================
 countryScheme - provides codes for country
 creditRatingScheme - Contains a code representing the credit rating agencies
 creditRatingNotationScheme - Contains a code representing the credit rating i.e., an evaluation of the credit worthiness of a debtor.
 creditRatingScaleScheme - The scale, which can be used to qualify the exposure duration, e.g., long term, short term, ...
 currencyScheme - provides codes for currency

Additional Information
======================
The Coding Schemes follow the content model defined by the CodeList.xsd schema file.

The FpML coding Schemes have been validated using Xerces J v 2.4.1.
