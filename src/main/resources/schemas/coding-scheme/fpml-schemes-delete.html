            <p>FpML uses a subset of the built-in datatypes (both primitive and derived datatypes) as defined in XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes, W3C Recommendation 02 May 2001. The built-in datatypes are described at:</p>
			
            <p>
				
               <a class="web" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#built-in-datatypes" target="_blank" title="Link opens in new window.">http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#built-in-datatypes</a>
			
            </p>
			
            <p>The built-in datatypes used in FpML are the following:</p>
			
            <ul class="bulleted">
				
               <li>boolean</li>
				
               <li>date</li>

               <li>time.</li>
			
            </ul>
			
            <p>The set of valid literals for each datatype are those defined in the XML Schema specification as being its lexical space. Additional constraints are imposed by FpML on the date and time built-in datatypes as described below.</p>

               </h4>
				
               <p>All elements of type date in FpML must contain date values with the format CCYY-MM-DD where "CC" represents the century, "YY" the year, "MM" the month and "DD" the day. The CCYY field must have exactly four digits, the MM and DD fields exactly two digits each; leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits. A following time zone qualifier is not allowed and year values must be in the range 0001 to 9999. For example, 25 May 2000 would be represented in FpML as 2000-05-25.</p>

               <p>All elements of type time in FpML must represent daily recurring instant of time values with the format hh:mm:ss where "hh", "mm" and "ss" represent hour, minute and second respectively. The hh, mm and ss fields must have exactly two digits each; leading zeroes must be used if the field would otherwise have too few digits. FpML imposes the further restriction that the second (ss) component must be '00' and a time zero qualifier is not allowed. For example, 00:00:00 (midnight), 01:00:00 (1:00am), 12:00:00 (midday), 23:30:00 (11:30pm).</p>

               <a id="s3.1">3.1 Introduction</a>
            </h3>
			
            <p>A number of data elements defined in FpML are restricted to holding one of a limited set of possible values, e.g. currency, business centers, etc. Such restricted sets of values are frequently referred to as domains.</p>
			
            <p>In FpML, two different codings of domains are used. Domains that are small and not expected to change during the life of the specification are coded using XML schema enumerations. These domains are described elsewhere, in particular in the fpml-enum schema file. Other domains are coded using a strategy that has been defined by the Architecture Working Group, referred to as 'Schemes'. Each Scheme is associated with a URI. Coding Schemes can be categorized as one of the following:</p>
			
            <ul class="bulleted">
				
               <li>An external coding Scheme, which has a well-known URI. In this case the URI is assigned by an external body, and may or may not have its own versioning, date syntax and semantics. The external body may be an open standards organization, or it may be a market participant. It's worth stating that a scheme provides alternate identifiers for one identity. However it is not used to identify things other than the identity of the thing that contains it.</li>
				
               <li>An external coding Scheme, which does not have a well-known URI. In this case FpML assigns a URI as a proxy to refer to the concept of the external Scheme, but this URI will not be versioned or dated</li>
				
               <li>An FpML-defined coding Scheme. In this case the Scheme is fully under FpML control and the URI will change reflecting newer versions and revisions as the scheme evolves and changes.</li>
			
            </ul>
			
            <p>In this section, the FpML-controlled Schemes and their associated URIs are defined, as well as URIs assigned by FpML to external coding schemes. The URI construction follows the FpML Architecture Version 2.1 recommendation.</p>
			
            <p>Note that FpML does not define a coding Scheme or URI for the following Schemes:</p>
			
            <ul class="bulleted">
				
               <li>Additional Data (additionalDataScheme)</li>
				
               <li>Conversation Identifier (conversationIdScheme)</li>
				
               <li>Event Identifier (eventIdScheme)</li>
				
               <li>Future Identifier (futureIdScheme)</li>
				
               <li>Index Name (indexNameScheme)</li>

               <li>Trade Status (tradeStatusScheme)</li>
				
               <li>Trader (traderScheme)</li>

            <p>These are currently assumed to be specific to individual organizations or FpML based implementations.</p>
			
            <p>Although the initial set of Schemes are defined in this document we expect that new versions of Schemes will be released from time to time and published separately. Key benefits of using Schemes are that they allow:</p>
			
            <ul class="bulleted">
				
               <li>enumerations to be revised without requiring a re-issue of the FpML schema files</li>
				
               <li>alternate Schemes to be used without requiring changes to the FpML schema files.</li>

      <h4>Description:</h4>
			
      <p>In general, the codes are based on the ISO country code and the English name of the location.</p>
			
      <p>Additional location codes can be built according to the following rules. The first two characters represent the ISO country code, the next two characters represent a) if the location name is one word, the first two letters of the location b) if the location name consists of at least two words, the first letter of the first word followed by the first letter of the second word.</p>
			
      <p>There are exceptions to this rule. For example, the TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system) business center for Euro settlement has a code of EUTA.</p>
			
      <p>This coding scheme is currently consistent with the S.W.I.F.T. Financial Center scheme used in the MT340/MT360/MT361 message definitions, although FpML controls the Business Center Scheme and it should not be assumed that both schemes will remain synchronized.</p>

      <h4>Description:</h4>
			
      <p>In general the codes are the ISO country code where the applicable law is the law of an entire country</p>
			
      <p>For countries that have more than one legal regime the code is constructed from the two-character ISO country code followed by two characters indicating the legal regime. In the cases of Canada and the United States of America, these two characters are the conventional abbreviations for the provinces and states respectively. In the case of the United Kingdom, the first two characters are "GB" followed by two characters indicating the legal regime.</p>
			
      <p>The following are examples of valid codes, not an exhaustive list.</p>
