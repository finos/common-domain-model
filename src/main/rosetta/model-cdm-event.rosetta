This is the date on which the additional shares are paid to the shareholders, or in the case of a reverse stock split, the number shares held by each shareholder is proportionally reduced.  Equity derivative transactions can be amended in firms' internal systems on such date.   In most markets, the listed stock price is reduced (or increased for a reverse stock split) to account for the split on the same date, but in some markets the price adjustment occurs on a later date.  In either case, equity derivative transactions should be amended on the date that the stocks are paid to the shareholders (or consolidated).">

type Trade: <"A class to represent the general trade concept, which can either be an execution or a contract. The execution consists essentially in the economic terms which are agreed between the parties. The contract will further qualify those with the legal entities (think of the allocation case, which execution state can involve the investment adviser rather not the actual funds) while not specify the master agreement or collateral terms which might be associated with the subsequent contract.">
