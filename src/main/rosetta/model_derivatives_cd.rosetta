/*
 * FpML cd validation rules perceived as needing extensions to the data rule syntax or calls to java functions:
 * - cd-15, cd-16, cd-17, cd-18 as they require to test the number of referenceObligation nodes
 * - cd-21, cd-21b, cd-22 as in order to test the condition that a trade is a short form, we need to have a like-type function to represent that an enumeration value that begins with string "iTraxx" or "CDX".
 * - cd-33 as there is a need for date computation by 'adding an integer multiple of the period in paymentFrequency to firstPaymentDate'
 * - cd-38 as there is a need to sum-up a set of values and check that their total = 1
