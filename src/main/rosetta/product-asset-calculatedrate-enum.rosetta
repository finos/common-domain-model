enum CalculationMethodEnum: <"What calculation type is required, averaging or compounding">
	Averaging  <"Averaging, i.e. arithmetic averaging">
	Compounding <"Compounding, i.e. geometric averaging following an ISDA defined formala">


enum ObservationPeriodDatesEnum: <"The enumerated values to specify whether rate calculations occur relative to the first or last day of a calculation period. Done in uppercase due to a bug in code generation.">
	SETINADVANCE displayName "Set in advance" <"calculations occur relative to the first day of a calculation period.">
	STANDARD displayName "Standard (set in arrears)"	<"calculations occur relative to the last day of a calculation period.">
	FIXINGDATE displayName "Original Fixing Date" <"calculations occur relative to a previously defined reset date, e.g. for a fallback rate.">  // BAL addition


enum CalculationShiftMethodEnum: <" the specific calculation method, e.g. lookback">
	lookback displayName "Lookback" <"calculations and weighting are done with respect to the calculation period, but observations are shifted back by several days">
	observationShift displayName "Observation Period Shift" <"the observation period is shifted by several days prior to rate setting, and weightings are done with respect to the obseration period">
	lockout displayName "Lockout (Rate Cut Off)"  <"calculations cut the rate off several business days prior to rate setting">
	noShift displayName "OIS Compounding/Basic Averaging" <"calculations occur without any shifting, e.g. OIS Compound style.">
