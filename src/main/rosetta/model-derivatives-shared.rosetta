In the case of a schedule, the step dates may be subject to adjustment in accordance with any adjustments specified in calculationPeriodDatesAdjustments. The spread is a per annum rate, expressed as a decimal. For purposes of determining a calculation period amount, if positive the spread will be added to the floating rate and if negative the spread will be subtracted from the floating rate. A positive 10 basis point (0.1%) spread would be represented as 0.001.">

A single floating rate tenor different to that used for the regular part of the calculation periods schedule may be specified, or two floating rate tenors many be specified. If two floating rate tenors are specified then Linear Interpolation (in accordance with the 2000 ISDA Definitions, Section 8.3 Interpolation) is assumed to apply. Alternatively, an actual known stub rate or stub amount may be specified.">

	floatingRate StubFloatingRate (0..2) <"The rates to be applied to the initial or final stub may be the linear interpolation of two different rates. While the majority of the time, the rate indices will be the same as that specified in the stream and only the tenor itself will be different, it is possible to specift two different rates. For example, a 2 month stub period may use the linear interpolation of a 1 month and 3 month rate. The different rates would be specified in this component. Note that a maximum of two rates can be specified. If a stub period uses the same floating rate index, including tenor, as the regular calculation periods then this should not be specified again within this component, i.e. the stub calculation period amount component may not need to be specified even if there is an initial or final stub period. If a stub period uses a different floating rate index compared to the regular calculation periods then this should be specified within this component.
