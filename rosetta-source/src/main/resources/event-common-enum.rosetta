The security holder may be offered the opportunity to join a class action proceeding and would need to respond with an instruction.">
    EarlyRedemption <"Corporate action triggered by an early redemption.

    Liquidation <"Corporate action triggered by a liquidation. When a business or firm is terminated or bankrupt, its assets are sold (liquidated) and the proceeds pay creditors.
