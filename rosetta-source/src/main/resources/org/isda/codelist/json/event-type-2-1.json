This major version of the            scheme introduces a simpler structure for describing reportable events in which the            events against each trade are reported separately. The type of event is indicated by a            structured code value. The first part of the code indicates the general action while            subsequent parts provide the specific context. Some codes signal that the trade has            reached an 'end of life' state where we not normally expect to see any further activity            once any final settlements have occurred. This new event classification is associated            with the Reporting Redesign Work available in FpML version 5.11 Recordkeeping View. ",
