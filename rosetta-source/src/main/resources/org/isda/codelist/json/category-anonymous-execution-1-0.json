{"identification":{"description":"Contains a flag for when a trade is being executed anonymously in a Swap            Execution Facility (SEF). It is meant to cover the requirement under CFTC 37.9(d)            https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2020/07/2020-14343a.pdf known as the PTNGU            (Post-Trade Name Give-Up) Rule. The rule requires that trades executed anonymously on a            SEF e.g. CLOB trades be guaranteed anonymity post-trade. Therefore the SEF requires the            ability to flag a trade as executed anonymously so that anonymity is guaranteed            throughout the workflow. Although the source of the trade is known, the SEF, not all            trades executed on the SEF will be flagged as anonymous. Therefore this needs to be            specified on a trade-by-trade basis.","publicationDate":"2020-12-14","shortName":"categoryScheme","version":"1-0","canonicalUri":"http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/category-anonymous-execution","canonicalVersionUri":"http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/category-anonymous-execution-1-0","locationUri":"http://www.fpml.org/coding-scheme/category-anonymous-execution-1-0.xml"},"codes":[{"value":"Anonymous","description":"The counterparty to the trade is not being disclosed.","source":"FpML","effectiveDate":"2020-12-14"},{"value":"Disclosed","description":"The counterparty to the trade is being disclosed.","source":"FpML","effectiveDate":"2020-12-14"}]}
