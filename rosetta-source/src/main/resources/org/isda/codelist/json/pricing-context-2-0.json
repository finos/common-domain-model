In            the context of Recordkeeping, the values (ClearingForcedTrade, Clearing DefaultTrade,            Inter-Affiliate, PackageOrBespoke, PrimeBrokerage) are related to the public reporting            i.e. they indicate why the public reporting for that particular trade might not have            reflected a market price (these values mirror the values on the public report itself).            The other values available for use in recordkeeping are to provide information why the            trade was not publicly reported.",
