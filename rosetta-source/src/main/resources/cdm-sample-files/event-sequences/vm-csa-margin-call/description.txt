An example of a Margin Call that resulted from a Variation Margin calculation. The input to the example is a single FX Forward New Trade Event. The subsequent Reset (soon to be renamed something more appropriate) and Payment events are to be generated by software implementation. The assumptions of this example is that the VM CSA document already exists and is referenced in the Fx Forward New Trade Event. Not captured as part of this example is 1/ the observation event on the 1-month forward rate as of end-of-day, and; 2/ the Function Specification describing how the payer and receiver were calculated in relation to the reset mark-to-market value.
