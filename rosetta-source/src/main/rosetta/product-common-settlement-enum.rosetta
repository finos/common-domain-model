As an example, when delivery versus payment occurs, say at termination of a physically settled option or swap, then one party is payer of the PrincipalPayment which is cash transfer, while being the receiving party of the corresponding deliverable asset, which is physical transfer. As another example, in case of principal exchange involved in cross currency swaps, a party is payer of PrincipalPayment in currency1 while being receiving party for PrincipalPayment in currency2. As a remark, when interim payments occurr for the purpose of resetting the Notional Amount exchanged on the variying currency leg, then there is just one PrincipalPayment which is not equal to the Notional Amount but just to the differential between reset Notional Amount and Notional Amount previously exchanged.">
