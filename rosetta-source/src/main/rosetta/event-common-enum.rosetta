The value maps closely to the ISO code (CLSA) defined as the situation where interested parties seek restitution for financial loss. The security holder may be offered the opportunity to join a class action proceeding and would need to respond with an instruction.">
	EarlyRedemption <"Corporate action triggered by an early redemption. The value maps closely to the ISO code (MCAL) defined as the redemption of an entire issue outstanding of securities, for example, bonds, preferred equity, funds, by the issuer or its agent, for example, asset manager, before final maturity.">
	Liquidation <"Corporate action triggered by a liquidation. When a business or firm is terminated or bankrupt, its assets are sold (liquidated) and the proceeds pay creditors.
