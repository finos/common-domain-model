It is also applied each day during the term of a repo, as part of the process of Margin Maintenance, to the Repurchase Price on that day to calculate the Market Value of collateral required subsequently in order to maintain adequate collateralisation. Under the GMRA, if there is a material difference between (1) the Repurchase Price of a repo plus any initial margin and (2) the current Market Value of collateral, that repo has a Transaction Exposure. This will go into the calculation of Net Exposure, which determines if either party has the right to call for Margin Maintenance. An initial margin can be expressed either as (1) the Market Value as a percentage of the Purchase Price or (2) a ratio of the two amounts. In the GMRA, an initial margin is called a Margin Ratio and is defined as a ratio but the market tends to quote a percentage. A percentage initial margin of 100% or ratio of one means there is no initial margin. See Guide 3.2"]
