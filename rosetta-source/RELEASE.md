# *Infrastructure - Restructure CDM Repository*

_What is being released_

This release restructures the CDM GitHub repository placing the source under it's own seperate sub module. This work facillitates the isolation of the CDM testing framework and the Rosetta source and brings the CDM repository structure into line with other CDM based model repositories.
