# *DSL Syntax - Reduce keyword to merge or aggregate a list*

_What is being released_

This release introduces the `reduce` keyword to merge or aggregate the items of a list into a single item based on an expression.  The `reduce` keyword can be used to implement simple operations such as summing a list of numbers, joining a list of strings, or finding a maximum or minimum value in a list, and well as operations on complex objects.

Upcoming releases will contain additional syntax to more concisely specify simple operations `sum`, `join`, `min` and `max`.

_Syntax_

```reduce <parameter1>, <parameter1> [ <expression to merge or aggregate any two list items, parameter1 and parameter2> ]```

_Example_

In the example below, the input list of numbers are combined by addition.

```
 func SumNumbers: 
    inputs:
        numbers number (0..*)
    output:
        total number (1..1)

    set total:
        numbers 
            reduce a, b [ a + b ]
```

_Example_

In the example below, the input list of strings are concatenated together along with a delimiter.  Given a list "a", "b", "c", and a delimiter ",", the resulting string would be "a,b,c".

```
 func JoinStrings: 
    inputs:
        strings string (0..*)
        delimiter string (1..1)
    output:
        result string (1..1)

    set result:
        strings 
            reduce a, b [ a + delimiter + b ]
```

_Example_

In the example below, the input list of numbers are aggregated to find the maximum number.  Given two list items, `n1` and `n2`; keep the greater item and discard the lesser item. 

```
 func FindMaxNumber: 
    inputs:
        numbers number (0..*)
    output:
        max number (1..1)

    set max:
        numbers 
            reduce n1, n2 [ if n1 > n2 then n1 else n2 ]
```

_Example_

In the example below, the input list of `Vehicle` are aggregated to find the vehicle with the most powerful engine.

```
 func FindVehicleWithMaxPower: 
    inputs:
        vehicles Vehicle (0..*)
    output:
        vehicleWithMaxPower Vehicle (1..1)

    set vehicleWithMaxPower:
        vehicles 
            reduce v1, v2 [ if v1 -> specification -> engine -> power > v2 -> specification -> engine -> power then v1 else v2 ]
```
