# *Legal Agreement Model - Workflow Event mappings*

_What is being released_

This release moves the `Workflow_Event` synonym mappings into a separate file, synonym-cdm-event.rosetta. Separating the model and synonym mappings improves readability and maintenance, and is consistent with other mappings, such as `FpML_5_10`.

_Review Directions_

In the CDM Portal, select the Textual Browser and search for the `Workflow_Event` synonyms.
