Before you start modelling
--------------------------

Please make sure you have gone through your pre-modelling checklist:

- Review the CDM Components and Principles
- Review the `Rosetta Starter Guide <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/core/0-welcome-to-rosetta.html>`_
- Get approval of conceptual design from stakeholders (for large model change)
