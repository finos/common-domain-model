Eligible Collateral Representation
==================================


Introduction
------------

Within collateral documentation, it is common to detail what assets you
will exchange with your counterparties, i.e., what you deem eligible
collateral. Such information is found in bilateral legal document,
custodian triparty agreements and is also used for other purposes where
defining whether an asset is eligible to be used as collateral to
mitigate risk on a defined set (portfolio) of financial instruments
between parties.

Data requirements to represent eligible collateral include common
information such as, asset descriptors e.g. who issues the asset, the
asset type, its maturity profile, any related agency credit risk rating,
and if any collateral haircut is to be applied to the asset’s value.

Within legal collateral documents, the definition of eligible collateral
can take several forms; some may want to list assets and the related
eligibility information in table-format using common language, use
textual description of types of eligible assets, or use common
identifiers and taxonomies. However, it is evident for each method
chosen there is no common data standard to express the same information
for all the data attributes used.

The financial crisis and the resulting regulatory framework that emerged
from guidelines outlined under BCBS/IOSCO and Basel III has presented
further requirements that define specific criteria for collateral
eligibility that must be applied to portfolios. Observation of different
regulations under various jurisdictions has presented several challenges
for defining collateral asset economic identity, correct categorisation
and application of specified haircuts and concentration limits. Having
no common standards in place to represent the key data has led to
lengthy negotiation, misinterpretation, lack of interoperability and
downstream operational inefficiency.


Eligible Collateral in the CDM
------------------------------

The CDM provides a standard digital representation of the data required
to express collateral eligibility for purposes such as representation in
legal agreements that govern transactions and workflows. The benefits of
this digital representation are summarized below:

-  Provides a comprehensive digital representation to support the data
   requirements to universally identify collateral types.

-  Includes ability to identify attributes of collateral that contribute
   to the risk like the type of asset, interest structures, economics,
   embedded options and unique characteristics.

-  Uses data standards to specify eligibility related information such
   as haircuts (regulatory credit quality, FX related or additional
   haircuts), agency or composite credit ratings and asset maturity
   terms

-  Provides functions to apply treatment rules to predefined collateral
   criteria such as include/exclude logic

-  Applies treatment rules for concentration limits caps by percentage
   or value. These can be applied to one or multiple elements of the
   collateral characteristics and defined criteria

-  Attributes are included to identify regulatory rules by defined
   eligibility identification categories published by regulatory bodies
   such as EMIR, CFTC and US Prudential

-  Provides a means of Identifying Schedules and constructing reusable
   collateral profiles

-  Standardises digital data representation components to construct the
   details to identify collateral eligibility not just for regulatory
   purposes but for all needs of eligibility expression within legal
   contracts and documentation

-  Promotes a standard format to represent eligible collateral for
   negotiators to identify and agree details without misinterpretation

-  Provides standards to facilitate Interoperability between platforms
   for digitised eligible collateral information

-  Connects contractual terms of eligibility in documentation to
   supporting processes

-  Standardises data records for audit requirements

-  Provides many opportunities in the collateral ecosystem and benefits
   a data representation of collateral choices that can be imported and
   exported to other systems such as credit, treasury, trade reporting
   and custodian platforms, providing a full workflow solution from
   negotiation, execution through to optimisation and settlement.


Modelling Approach
------------------

Scope
^^^^^

The model’s primary intention is to deliver standards for OTC
Derivatives with a focus on uncleared margin rules. In addition, the
approach is intended to also be used to express collateral eligibility
for other industry workflows such as Securities Lending, Repo and
Exchange Traded Derivatives (ETD). The model foundations, broad range of
attributes and functions has been constructed with this in mind and can
be extended further to operate to wider processes.

The common data requirements have been established through industry
working groups reviewing a wide range of examples in order to identify
collateral for the purpose of constructing eligible collateral specifications,
including representation of additional attributes for regulatory risk
and credit factors. For the purpose of understanding the principle,
these can be divided into the following categories:

-  Issuer Identification

-  Asset Identification

-  Collateral Haircuts

-  Maturity Ranges

-  Concentrations Limits

-  Treatments Functions

The data attributes within the model provides the flexibility to firstly
identify the collateral issuer and asset class, then define its maturity
if relevant, then apply treatment rules for any chosen haircut
percentages, concentration limits and inclusion or exclusion conditions.
The combination of these terms allows a wide range of collateral and
associated data for eligibility to be represented.

Approach to identifying Collateral Assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The universe of collateral used throughout the industry for risk
mitigation purposes is vast and the intention is for the CDM to provide
a standard means of identifying as much of this collateral universe as
possible initially and then extend the model further as required via
open-source contributions under the CDM governance structure.

At the outset, there have been no common standards for describing
collateral; the foundational structure in the CDM provides a means to
identify a majority of collateral issuers and covers a wide range of
asset types that are commonly seen in eligible collateral data.

The approach in the CDM is to adopt a similar method to the 'Animal
Kingdom' tree and taxonomy (kingdom → phylum → class → order→ family →
genus → species) – i.e., that there is one method for describing any of
the core attributes of an "animal" (i.e., type of issuer/type of
asset/type of economic terms) that need to be referenced, but only one
way. Each issuer type, asset type, economic type etc has a unique place
in the universe of collateral but is logically grouped together with
similar types.

An illustrative example for understanding the principle is shown here:

.. image:: images/collateral-asset-identifier-tree.png
   :width: 6.85159in
   :height: 3.24844in

The CDM method for representing eligible collateral will be capable of
reference to, and inclusion in, common master and respective collateral
documentation for OTC Derivatives and non- OTC master agreements
(notably Repo and Securities Lending) and potentially for OTC Cleared
and Exchange Traded Derivatives. For this reason, it is important that
the CDM is able to accommodate Regulatory Uncleared Margin Rules
concepts that are relevant but the model should not prescribed by them.

Although the industry will benefit from using a digital standard to
describe collateral, there is also a need to recognise that market
participants may want to identify eligible collateral without fully
describing every feature and instead use industry identifiers, where
available. Thus, the CDM also provides a means that collateral issuers
can be identified using common legal entity identifiers such as an LEI.
Similarly, asset types can be identified using a product ID such as ISIN
or CUSIP or a standard taxonomy source.

High Level Design Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The foundational data structure from the highest level allows firstly to
represent eligibility through specification of *criteria*:

.. image:: images/cdm-graphical-ecs.png
   :width: 6.26806in
   :height: 1.1083in

The Asset type is used to specify criteria related to the nature of the
asset, such as its type (cash, debt, equity, or other), its country of
origin or its denominated currency.

The Issuer type is used to specify criteria related to the issuer of the
asset, such the type of issuer (government, corporate, etc), specific
issuer name, or agency rating

Treatment is used to specify the valuation percentage, any concentration
limits and or specific inclusion or exclusion conditions, which
additionally apply to filter whether a piece of collateral is eligible
or not.

The combination of these terms allows a wide variety of eligible
collateral types to be represented and a structure can be used to identify
individual collateral types or a group of collateral assets for
inclusion in specifying eligible collateral schedule details.


Identifying Eligible Collateral using the CDM Data Structure
------------------------------------------------------------

A combination of data types can be used to describe the collateral
asset, its origin and its issuer. Data type ``EligibleCollateralCriteria``
extends ``CollateralCriteriaBase`` and contains data types to enable to
define collateral Asset and Issuer characterises

Asset Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data type ``AssetCriteria`` is used to specify the definition of the
collateral asset, this includes the following data attributes:

.. code-block:: Haskell

 type AssetCriteria:
   collateralAssetType AssetType (0..*)
   assetCountryOfOrigin string (0..*)
     [metadata scheme]
   denominatedCurrency string (0..*)
     [metadata scheme]
   agencyRating AgencyRatingCriteria (0..*)
   maturityType MaturityTypeEnum (0..1)
   maturityRange PeriodRange (0..1)
   productIdentifier ProductIdentifier (0..*)
   collateralTaxonomy CollateralTaxonomy (0..*)
   domesticCurrencyIssued boolean (0..1)
   listing ListingType (0..1)

	condition AssetCriteriaChoice:
		optional choice collateralAssetType, collateralTaxonomy, productIdentifier

-  ``collateralAssetType`` Represents a filter based on the asset product type.


-  ``collateralAssetType`` Represents a filter based on the
   asset product type.

-  ``assetCountryOfOrigin`` Represents a filter based on the
   issuing entity country of origin.

-  ``denominatedCurrency`` Represents a filter based on the
   underlying asset denominated currency.

-  ``agencyRating`` Represents an agency rating
   based on default risk and creditors claim in event of default
   associated with specific instrument.

-  ``maturityType`` Specifies whether the maturity
   range is the remaining or original maturity.

-  ``maturityRange`` Represents a filter based on the
   underlying asset maturity.

-  ``productIdentifier`` Represents a filter based
   on specific instrument identifiers (e.g. specific ISINs, CUSIPs etc)

-  ``collateralTaxonomy`` Specifies the collateral
   taxonomy, which is composed of a taxonomy value and a taxonomy
   source.

-  ``domesticCurrencyIssued`` Identifies that the Security
   must be denominated in the domestic currency of the issuer.

-  ``ListingType`` Specifies the exchange, index or
   sector specific to listing of a security.

Each of the ``AssetCriteria`` data attributes in the model provides further
granularity to describe the asset, either as basic types or complex
types, for example:

-  ``collateralAssetType`` can be used to define further by ``AssetType`` such
   as ``securityType``, ``debtType``, ``equityType``, or ``fundType``. Each of these can
   be used to represent data in further granularity if required
   providing more enumeration options. These are covered in further
   examples throughout this guide.

-  ``assetCountryOfOrigin`` and ``denominatedCurrency`` are ‘string’ basic types
   and can be populated by a country name, code or currency
   abbreviations.

-  ``domesticCurrencyIssued`` is a Boolean data attribute option to specify
   True or False.

-  ``AgencyRatingCriteria`` and maturityType are explained in more detail in
   further examples throughout this guide.

Issuer Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The data type ``IssuerCriteria`` is used to specify the issuer of a
collateral asset, this includes the following data attributes:

.. code-block:: Haskell

 type IssuerCriteria:
   issuerType CollateralIssuerType (0..*)
   issuerCountryOfOrigin string (0..*)
     [metadata scheme]
   issuerName LegalEntity (0..*)
   issuerAgencyRating AgencyRatingCriteria (0..*)
   sovereignAgencyRating AgencyRatingCriteria (0..*)
   counterpartyOwnIssuePermitted boolean (0..1)

-  ``issuerType`` Represents a filter based on
   the type of entity issuing the asset.

-  ``issuerCountryOfOrigin`` Represents a filter based on the
   issuing entity country of origin, which is the same as filtering by
   eligible Sovereigns.

-  ``issuerName`` Specifies the issuing entity name or
   LEI.

-  ``issuerAgencyRating`` Represents an agency
   rating based on default risk and creditors claim in event of default
   associated with asset issuer.

-  ``sovereignAgencyRating`` Represents an
   agency rating based on default risk of country.

-  ``counterpartyOwnIssuePermitted`` Represents a filter
   based on whether it is permitted for the underlying asset to be
   issued by the posting entity or part of their corporate family.

For each of the ``IssuerCriteria`` options, the model will provide further
options of granularity; for example ``issuerType`` will allow you to define
further express data for the detail to be more specific to the type of
issuer for example: ``SovereignCentralBank``, ``QuasiGovernment``,
``RegionalGovernment`` and so on., If necessary, each will offer further
levels of granularity relevant to each issuer type. These will be
covered in more detail and in further examples throughout this guide.

Other attributes of ``IssuerCriteria`` can be used and added to your issuer
description, if required, and will give various levels of granularity
dependent on their nature and purpose in describing the issuer. For
example ``issuerCountryOfOrigin`` is a free format ‘string’ representation
to be populated by a country name, code.

``counterpartyOwnIssuePermitted`` is a Boolean data option to specify Y/N.
``issuerName`` is used to express a legal entity id as a ‘string’. Whereas,
other attributes will have more detailed options such as
``IssuerAgencyRating`` These will be covered in more detail and in further
examples throughout this guide.


Treatment Functions
-------------------

Treatment rules can be applied to eligible collateral in several ways
using data type ``CollateralTreatment`` which specifies the treatment terms
for the eligible collateral criteria specified . This includes a number
of options which are listed below:

-  ``ValuationTreatment`` Specification of the valuation treatment for the
   specified collateral, such as haircuts percentages.

-  ``concentrationLimit`` Specification of concentration limits applicable
   to the collateral criteria.

-  ``isIncluded`` A boolean attribute to specify whether collateral criteria
   are inclusion (True) or exclusion (False) criteria\ **.**

The CDM model is flexible so that these treatment rules can be applied
to the detail of data expression for eligible collateral on an
individual basis or across a group of issuer names or asset types or
combinations of both. Each treatment function will have its own set of
options and the model will provide further options of granularity.

Valuation Treatments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CollateralValuationTreatment`` will allow for representation of different
types of haircuts, as follows . Please note: data expression for
percentages is a number with a condition to be expressed as a decimal
between 0 and 1.

-  ``haircutPercentage`` Specifies a haircut percentage to be applied to the
   value of asset and used as a discount factor to the value of the
   collateral asset, expressed as a percentage in decimal terms.

-  ``marginPercentage`` Specifies a percentage value of transaction needing
   to be posted as collateral expressed as a valuation.

-  ``fxHaircutPercentage`` Specifies an FX haircut applied to a specific
   asset which is agreed between the parties.

-  ``AdditionalHaircutPercentage`` Specifies a percentage value of any
   additional haircut to be applied to a collateral asset, the
   percentage value is expressed as the discount haircut to the value of
   the collateral.

Concentration Limits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ConcentrationLimit``,is another form of treatment which has a set of
attributes which allow concentration limits to be defined in two
alternative ways using ``ConcentrationLimitCriteria``

*Generic method* : If you wish to apply a concentration limit to a set
of pre-defined eligible collateral details in the CDM, you would use
``ConcentrationLimitType``, ``ConcentrationLimitTypeEnum`` which allows you to
define which existing details to apply the concentration limit to from
an enumeration list including (Asset, Base currency, Issuer, Primary
Exchange, Sector.. etc)

*Specific method* : If you wish to apply a concentration limit to a
specific asset or issuer of asset, you would use the
``ConcentrationLimitCriteria``. This extends ``CollateralCriteriaBase`` and
allows you be more specific using the granular structures of the
``IssuerCriteria`` and ``AssetCriteria`` to specify the details of the issuer or
asset you want to apply the concentration limit.

In addition, you would need to specify the form of the Concentration
limit being used as a value limit range to apply a cap (upper bound) or
floor (lower bound) to the identified asset, issuer or attributes. There
are two options that allow this to be represented in value or percentage
terms as follows:

.. code-block:: Haskell

 type ConcentrationLimit:
   concentrationLimitCriteria ConcentrationLimitCriteria (0..*)
   valueLimit MoneyRange (0..1)
   percentageLimit NumberRange (0..1)

-  ``ValueLimit`` Specifies the value of collateral limit
   represented as a range

-  ``percentageLimit`` Specifies the percentage of
   collateral limit represented as a decimal number

There are conditions in the CDM when applying concentration limits that
constrain choices to:

-  one of the concentration limit methods (either a limit type or limit
   criteria must be specified)

-  one concentration limit type (either a value limit or percentage
   limit concentration must be specified)

Inclusion Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The collateral treatment function ``isIncluded`` can be used as a treatment
term for the eligible collateral criteria specified and indicate if the
collateral is eligible or not. Therefore a Boolean data attribute is
applied using one of the following:

-  (True) Collateral Inclusion

-  (False) Collateral Exclusion


Additional Granular Information for Eligible Collateral Data Construction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CDM data structure to express collateral eligibility has been
explored in more detail and it has been demonstrated where the
``EligibleCollateralCriteria`` can be broken down into data related to
``IssuerCriteria`` and ``AssetCriteria`` and rules can be applied using data for
CollateralTreatment.

The following section focuses on the more granular details of the
various data attributes available through ``IssuerCriteria`` and
``AssetCriteria``.

Collateral Asset and Issuer Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under data types for both ``IssuerCriteria`` and ``AssetCriteria`` the first
data attributes available to detail collateral are ``issuerType`` and
``collateralAssetType`` these will offer additional data.

**Defining Collateral Issuers:**

``issuerType`` allows for multiple expressions of data related to the issuer
using ``CollateralIssuerType`` containing data attributes as follows:

``issuerType IssuerTypeEnum`` Specifies the origin of entity issuing the collateral
with the following enumerations shown as examples but not limited to:

-  SupraNational

-  SovereignCentralBank

-  RegionalGovernment

-  Corporate

Some attributes are extended to allow further granularity as shown in
the examples below:

``supraNationalType`` Represents types of
supranational entity issuing the asset, such as international
organisations and multilateral banks – with enumerations to define:

-  InternationalOrganisation

-  MultilateralBank

**Defining Collateral Assets:**

``collateralAssetType`` allows for multiple expressions of data related to
the collateral asset using ``AssetType`` which has further data
attributes as follows:

assetType - Represents the type of collateral asset with data attributes as enumerations to define

-  Security

-  Cash

-  Commodity

-  Other Collateral Products

``securityType`` - Represents the type of security with data attributes to define, as examples:

-  Debt

-  Equity

-  Fund

``debtType`` - Represents a filter based on the type of bond
which includes further optional granularity for certain characteristics
that may be required to define specific details related to debt type
assets such but not limited to as follows:

-  DebtClass

   -  Asset Backed

   -  Convertible

   -  RegCap

   -  Structured


-  DebtEconomics

   -  Debt Seniority

      -  *Secured*

      -  *Senior*

      -  *Subordinated*

   -  Debt Interest

      -  *Fixed*

      -  *Floating*

      -  *Inflation Linked*

   -  Debt Principal

      -  *Bullet*

      -  *Callable*

      -  *Puttable*

      -  *Amortising*

A similar structure exists for ``equityType`` and ``fundType`` and other
collateral assets types.

As well as defining the details of the asset and issuer of collateral
using the various attributes available in the CDM description tree,
there are other detailed criteria that may be required to define
collateral and for use in expressing eligibility details; the guide will
detail these and indicate the data structure available to define them.

Agency Ratings Criteria (Used within both Issuer and Asset Criteria)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The use of specifying agency rating criteria for credit purposes can be
useful for many means in legal documentation to drive operational
outcomes such as collateral thresholds and event triggers. When defining
collateral eligibility, the CDM can represent collateral underlying
credit default risk in various ways by using agency rating sources.
These are useful and common for determining eligible collateral between
parties and those defined under regulatory rules for posting certain
margin types.

The model components are specified in the CDM using data type
``AgencyRatingCriteria`` : - Represents class to specify multiple credit
notations alongside a conditional 'any' or 'all' qualifier.

For the purpose of use in defining eligible collateral this can be
applied to the following data attributes:

-  ``IssuerCriteria`` > ``issuerAgencyRating`` - Represents an agency rating
   based on default risk and creditors claim in event of default
   associated with asset issuer

-  ``IssuerCriteria`` > ``sovereignAgencyRating`` - Represents an agency rating
   based on default risk of the country of the issuer

-  ``AssetCriteria`` > ``agencyRating`` - Represents an agency rating based on
   default risk and creditors claim in event of default associated with
   specific instrument

Data type ``AgencyRatingCriteria`` Allows specification of the following
related information to eligible collateral

.. code-block:: Haskell

 type AgencyRatingCriteria:
   qualifier QuantifierEnum (1..1)
   creditNotation CreditNotation (1..*)
   mismatchResolution CreditNotationMismatchResolutionEnum (0..1)
   referenceAgency CreditRatingAgencyEnum (0..1)
   boundary CreditNotationBoundaryEnum (0..1)

-  ``qualifier`` Indicator for whether *all or any* of
   the agency ratings specified apply using the All or Any enumeration
   contained within QuantifierEnum

-  ``creditNotation`` Indicates the agency rating
   criteria specified for the asset or issuer. This expands to offer
   further granularity for details relating to the credit details

.. code-block:: Haskell

 type CreditNotation:
   agency CreditRatingAgencyEnum (1..1)
   notation string (1..1)
     [metadata scheme]
   scale string (0..1)
     [metadata scheme]
   debt CreditRatingDebt (0..1)
   outlook CreditRatingOutlookEnum (0..1)
   creditWatch CreditRatingCreditWatchEnum (0..1)


- ``CreditRatingAgencyEnum`` A list of enumerated values to specify the rating agency or agencies, (all major rating agencies are supported)

- ``notation`` Specifies the credit rating notation. As itvaries among credit rating agencies, the CDM does not currently specify each specific rating listed by each agency. The data‘string’ allows the free format field to be populated with a rating , such as ‘AAA’

- ``scale`` Specifies the credit rating scale, with a typical distinction between short term, long term. The data ‘string’ allows the free format field to be populated 	with a scale indicator such as ‘long term’, ‘short term'.

- ``debt`` Specifies the credit rating debt type is for any credit notation associated debt related credit attributes if needed. This gives the additional flexibility option to identify amongst the credit criteria debt characteristics such as (high yield, deposits, investments grade) The data type extends to offer two options

  - ``debtType`` This attribute is free format 'string' and used when only one debt type is specified

  - ``debtTypes`` This allows you to specify for than one multiple debt type characteristics and has a qualifying conditions to specify if you wish to include ‘All’ or ‘Any’ of the elements listed in scope

- ``outlook`` This data attributes allows you to specify the a credit rating outlook assessment that is commonly determine by rating agencies. It is an indication of the 	  potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate term, which is generally up to two years for investment grade and generally up to one year for 	speculative grade. The enumeration list allows you to specify if required one of the following outlook terminology

  -  Positive (A rating may be raised)

  -  Negative (A rating may be lowered)

  -  Stable (A rating is not likely to change)

  -  Developing (A rating may be raised, lowered, or affirmed)

- ``creditWatch`` Similar to detailing a type of credit outlook, credit agencies will also identify individual credit by a means of a monitoring (watch) status for an undefined period. This watch status can be expressed using the following data terminology under this enumeration list.

  -  Positive (A rating may be raised)

  -  Negative (A rating may be lowered)

  -  Developing (A rating may be raised, lowered, or affirmed)

-  ``mismatchResolution`` If several agency issue ratings are being specified that are not
   necessarily equivalent of each, this data attribute allows you to
   label which one has certain characteristics amongst the others, such
   as lowest or highest etc, the following enumerations are available:

   -  Lowest

   -  Highest

   -  Reference Agency

   -  Average

   -  Second Best

.. code-block:: Haskal

 enum CreditNotationMismatchResolutionEnum:
	Lowest
	Highest
	ReferenceAgency
	Average
	SecondBest

-  ``referenceAgency`` This part of the agency rating criteria again allows you to specify from the list of enumerated values for the rating agency. But in this case it is to identify the rating agency if you need to determine one from others if you used the data attribute referenceAgency in the ``CreditNotationMismatchResolutionEnum`` as outlined above.

- ``boundary`` Indicates the boundary of a credit agency rating i.e minimum or maximum.

A condition exists If the mismatch resolution choice is
``ReferenceAgency``, you must ensure that the reference agency is specified
through the ``CreditRatingAgencyEnum``

*For example:*

Through ``CreditNotation`` the following data has been specified:

S&P AAA

Moodys Aaa

Fitch AAA

Then one of these needed to be specified as the dominant rating as an
example (Moodys), you would express ``mismatchResolution`` >
``CreditNotationMismatchResolutionEnum`` > **ReferenceAgency**

``referenceAgency`` > ``CreditRatingAgencyEnum`` > **Moodys**

Collateral Taxonomy (Used within Asset Criteria)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is understood that data used to determine asset types used in
specifying eligible collateral information can often refer to common structured
standard pre-defined taxonomy sources. Although the purpose of the CDM
is to encourage one standard representation of data for asset types,
there are circumstances where assets are organised and labelled into
categories, such as by regulators. In some circumstances, it may be a
requirement to refer to these identifiable sources. In the CDM, these
taxonomy sources can be referenced in a consistent representation.

The CDM allows the definition of, and reference to, certain taxonomy
sources to be used to express details for eligibility. These can be used
as an additional means of expressing asset types outside of the
descriptions tree or alongside it. Under data type ``AssetCriteria`` there
are data attributes to reference collateral related taxonomy sources as
follows:

Data Type ``collateralTaxonomy`` will allow for
specification of the collateral taxonomy, which is composed of a
taxonomy value and a taxonomy source.

-  The data attribute ``taxonomySource`` must be
   specified and will provide the following options through the
   enumerations list:

   -  CFI (The ISO 10962 Classification of Financial Instruments code)

   -  ISDA (The ISDA product taxonomy)

   -  ICAD (ISDA Collateral Asset Definition Identifier code)

   -  EU EMIR Eligible Collateral Asset Class (European Union Eligible
      Collateral Assets classification categories based on EMIR
      Uncleared Margin Rules)

   -  UK EMIR Eligible Collateral Asset Class (UK EMIR Eligible
      Collateral Assets classification categories based on UK EMIR
      Uncleared Margin Rules)

   -  US CFTC PR Eligible Collateral Asset Class (US Eligible Collateral
      Assets classification categories based on Uncleared Margin Rules
      published by the CFTC and the US Prudential Regulators)

The options CFI, ISDA and ICAD would be further expressed with the
flexible data *‘string’* representation through data type
``ProductTaxonomy``.

However the regulatory ‘Eligible Collateral Asset Class’ rules have
individual enumeration lists unique to their asset class categories
identified under each of the respective regulatory bodies. Therefore if
these are selected as taxonomy sources through TaxonomySourceEnum it is
required to specify details from the related unlimited enumeration lists that
exist under data type CollateralTaxonomyValue, these are shown below:

-  ``eu_EMIR_EligibleCollateral``

-  ``uk_EMIR_EligibleCollateral``

-  ``us_CFTC_PR_EligibleCollateral``

-  ``nonEnumeratedTaxonomyValue``

Please note: The regime codes are not mandatory and are based on
reference to the regulatory eligible categories, but do not qualify the
regulations. The CDM only provides a standard data representation so
that institutions can recognise the same information.

Each enumeration has a full description of what regulatory published
rules the list of eligible collateral assets classification
codes/categories are based on. Under each enumeration list there are a
number of categorised eligible asset groups which have been identified
under each set of regulatory rules. Some limited examples of these are
shown below which are contained in the ``EU_EMIR_EligibleCollateralEnum``
list:

-  ``EU_EMIRTypeA`` -Denotes Cash in the form of money credited to an
   account in any currency, or similar claims for the repayment of
   money, such as money market deposits.

-  ``EU_EMIRTypeB`` - Denotes gold in the form of allocated pure gold
   bullion of recognised good delivery.

-  ``EU_EMIRTypeC`` -Denotes debt securities issued by Member States'
   central governments or central banks.

The cardinality for these enumeration lists (0..*) denotes that multiple
values can be provided so several categories can be applied to a line of
data expressed in an eligibility profile.

The final attribute in ``CollateralTaxonomyValue``,
``nonEnumeratedTaxonomyValue``, offers additional data
expression outside of the listed taxonomy values, for use when a
taxonomy value is not enumerated in the model.

There are conditions associated to the use of the data attributes within
``CollateralTaxonomyValue`` to ensure correct use of the data. These
conditions enforce the specified regulatory enumerated list to match the
taxonomy source. Therefore as an example you can only specify a category
from the EMIR enumerations list if the taxonomy source is
``EU_EMIR_EligibleCollateralAssetClass``

Maturity Profiles (Used within Asset Criteria)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The expression of collateral life span periods and specific maturity
dates is a common eligibility characteristic and may be needed for
determining other key collateral treatments such as haircut percentages.
The CDM has various approaches for representing assets maturities, they
are data attributes within the data type ``AssetCriteria`` as follows:

-  ``maturityType`` - Allows specification of the
   type of maturity range and has the following enumerated values:

   -  Remaining Maturity

   -  Original Maturity

   -  From Issuance

-  ``maturityRange``  Allows filtering on the underlying
   asset maturity through definition of a lower and upper bound range
   using data type ``PeriodRange``. Using ``PeriodBound`` for both ends
   of the scale you would need to specify the period, for example:

   -  ``lowerBound`` 1Y , representing one year using the ``Period`` >
      ``periodMultiplier`` **1** and period ``PeriodEnum`` **Y**

   -  ``upper bound`` 5Y, representing 5 years using the ``Period`` >
      ``periodMultiplier`` **5** and period ``PeriodEnum`` **Y**

   -  In addition ``PeriodBound`` has the inclusive boolean to
      indicate whether the period bound is inclusive, e.g. for a lower
      bound, false would indicate greater than, whereas true would
      indicate greater than or equal to.

A combination of these data attributes combined allows specificity of
the maturity profile of collateral asset types and definition of a range
that would sit alongside the other asset data criteria. Multiple
maturity ranges can be listed for and associated to one asset type,
varied collateral treatment haircuts can then be added to each of the
ranges, this would be a common feature of a collateral eligibility
schedule especially if there is an uncleared margin rules regulatory
requirement.

Product Identifier (Used within Asset Criteria)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CDM model as described throughout this guide will allow the user to
define collateral assets through the granular structure of the
``AssetCriteria``, but we must understand that expression of asset details
for eligibility purposes can take other forms across the universe of
collateral, for some processes there is a requirement to use certain
product identifiers. Data type ``productIdentifier`` can be used to express
specific instrument identifiers such as ISINs, CUSIPs etc. There is a
section within the CDM documentation that covers this area of the model,
this can be found in the following link :ref:`products-with-identifiers-section`.

Listing (Used within Asset Criteria)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additional details may be required to describe asset characteristics
related to a securities financial listing, exchange, sector or specified
indices, if relevant these are used to express eligibility details in
documentation and collateral profiles. The data type listing ``ListingType``
contained within ``AssetCriteria`` can be used to specification such
listing criteria. This expands to three attributes that can be used
individually or together :

-  exchange string (0..1) Represents a filter based on the primary stock
   exchange facilitating the listing of companies, exchange of Stocks,
   Exchange traded Derivatives, Bonds, and other Securities.

-  sector string (0..1) Represents a filter based on an industry sector
   defined under a system for classifying industry types such as ‘Global
   Industry Classification Standard (GICS)’ and ‘North American Industry
   Classification System (NAICS) or other related industry sector
   reference data.

-  index Index (0..1) – Represents a filter based on an index that
   measures a stock market, or a subset of a stock market. The \`Index\`
   data type can be used in the CDM to define an index in terms of a
   \`ProductIdentifier’ and an enumeration identifying the index
   constituent type.


Using The CDM Data Representation to Construct Eligible Collateral Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This user guide provides an overview of the data available to represent
details for expressing eligibility inclusive of the asset criteria,
issuer criteria and the collateral treatment inclusion rules, valuation
percentages and concentration limits. However, a combination of how the
data is represented and structured will determine specific outcomes.

The data can be specified and organised as a list of attributes, such as
descriptive details of the asset and the issuer, to identify the makeup
of collateral.

This list can be made up of multiple attributes from both the asset or
issuer criteria and be grouped together. Items listed in this way using
the same level in the CDM are defined as an ‘and’ relationship. However,
opportunities exist in the CDM data structure to extended lists within a
list and add another level to both asset and issuer criteria which will
operate as an ‘or’ relationship. An example of this would be within data
type ``AssetCriteria`` there is an option to define a ``denominatedCurrency``
(0..*); this data attribute with an open cardinality allows for a
definition of a list of currencies and describes where a ‘or’
relationship exists.

Each list combination identified in this way can then have specific
treatment rules applied to it.

For example, a simple list can be constructed as follows:

AssetCriteria>

-  collateralAssetType>assetType: **CASH**

-  denominatedCurrency: **USD**

And then the following treatment applied to the list

Treatment>

-  isIncluded: **TRUE**

-  haircutPercentage\ **: 0.005**

The outcome is- USD CASH IS ELIGIBLE AT 99.5% VALUE/ or WITH 0.5%
HAIRCUT

To extend this example further a digital JSON output extract of the same
details is show here:

.. code-block:: Javascript

 {
 "criteria": [{
    "asset": [{
          "collateralAssetType": [{
            	"assetType": "CASH"
      		}],
          "denominatedCurrency": [{
            	"value": "USD"
 }]
          }],
        "treatment": {
            "haircutPercentage": {
                "haircutPercentage": 0.005
                },
            "isIncluded": true
            }
