CDM Documentation Style Guide
=============================

The purpose of this section is to provide recommendations for CDM Documentation style and substance. "Documentation" in this context means any form of written guidance to CDM users and includes:

- the CDM User Documentation
- release notes provided with each CDM release
- any description developed in the logical model itself, which includes:

  - data types and attributes
  - enumerations
  - functions and rules
  - test descriptions
  - any other areas of the logical model where a textual description may be provided

The baseline for the recommendation is standards for spelling, punctuation, and other style rules applicable to British English, such as those found in `New Hartâ€™s Rules <https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-harts-rules-9780199570027>`_. The recommendation in this document extends this rule set with a set of guidelines applicable to documentation for logical models. The recommendation does not provide an exhaustive list of all of the standard British English rules, but provides selective examples that are common to documentation in general.

The intended audience for the CDM Documentation includes software developers, data modelers, legal experts, business experts, and other subject matter experts who may have expertise in one area related to financial products, but are not experts in every area.

Unless otherwise noted, the recommended rules apply to all forms of CDM Documentation. When rules are applicable only to certain forms of Documentation (for instance, the logical model descriptions or the release notes), they will be specified as such.
