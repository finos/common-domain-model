CDM Documentation Style Guide
=============================

The purpose of this section is to provide recommendations for CDM documentation style and substance. "Documentation" in this context means any form of written guidance to CDM users and includes:

- the CDM user documentation
- release notes provided with each CDM release
- any description developed in the logical model itself, which includes:

  - data types and attributes
  - enumerations
  - functions and rules
  - test descriptions
  - any other areas of the logical model where a textual description may be provided

The baseline for the recommendation is standards for spelling, punctuation, and other style rules applicable to British English, such as those found in `New Hartâ€™s Rules <https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-harts-rules-9780199570027>`_. The recommendation in this document extends this rule set with a set of guidelines applicable to documentation for logical models. The recommendation does not provide an exhaustive list of all of the standard British English rules, but provides selective examples that are common to documentation in general.

The intended audience for the CDM documentation includes software developers, data modelers, legal experts, business experts, and other subject matter experts who may have expertise in one area related to financial products, but are not experts in every area.

Unless otherwise noted, the recommended rules apply to all forms of CDM documentation. When rules are applicable only to certain forms of Documentation (for instance, the logical model descriptions or the release notes), they will be specified as such.

Terminology
-----------

The CDM
^^^^^^^

The model should be referred to as *the CDM*, without any ownership mention. The only exception is the `Overview of the ISDA CDM <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/readme.html>`_ at the beginning of the user documentation when the CDM is introduced as *the ISDA CDM*.

General data definition components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The two data definition components should be referred to as follows:

#. Data type: defines an entity with a description, attributes, and where applicable, conditions.

   #. Not type.
   #. Not class: although these are appropriate terms for some of the distributions of the CDM into other languages, they are not applicable for all.

#. Attribute: defines a member of a data type.

   #. Not field.
   #. Not element.

Specific components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Product
"""""""

#. Financial Product. The user documentation defines `Financial Product <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/documentation/source/documentation.html#financial-product>`_ as the highest level of the hierarchy of the universe of products. The term *Financial Product* should be used consistently throughout the documentation and wherever applicable in the model descriptions when describing the broad set of products.
#. Contractual Product. Similarly, `Contractual Product <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/documentation/source/documentation.html#contractual-product>`_ is defined as a subset of Financial Products and should be used consistently in any documentation.

   #. Not Derivatives.
   #. Not OTC. Contractual Product is at a higher hierarchy level than OTC Derivatives because it can include other types of products such as Security Financing.

Event
"""""

#. Business Event. In the CDM, `Business Events <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/documentation/source/documentation.html#business-event>`_ represent a lifecycle event of a trade.  When referring to these data structures in the CDM, the term *Business Event* should be consistently used rather than Lifecycle Event.
#. Primitive Event. In the CDM, `Primitive Events <https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/documentation/source/documentation.html#primitive-event>`_ are the building block components used to specify business events in the CDM.  In the user documentation and model descriptions, the word *Primitive* always needs to be qualified with *Event*, because the word *Primitive* (stand-alone) may be associated to very different meanings, e.g. in computing.
