The Common Domain Model
=======================

**There are seven modelling dimensions** to the CDM:

* Product
* Event
* Legal Agreement
* Process
* Reference Data
* Mapping (Synonym)
* Namespace

The first section defines the general design principles of the CDM. The following sections define each of the CDM modelling dimensions. Selected examples of model definitions are used as illustrations to help explain each dimension and include, where applicable, data samples to help demonstrate the structure. All the Rosetta DSL modelling components that are used to express the CDM are described in the `Rosetta DSL Documentation`_

The complete model definition, including descriptions and other details can be viewed in the `Textual Browser <https://portal.cdm.rosetta-technology.io/#/text-browser>`_ on the ISDA CDM Portal.
