            <SimpleValue>Bankruptcy</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by bankruptcy. A legal proceeding involving a person or business that is unable to repay outstanding debts. The bankruptcy process begins with a petition filed by the debtor (most common) or on behalf of creditors (less common). All of the debtor's assets are measured and evaluated, whereupon the assets are used to repay a portion of outstanding debt. Upon the successful completion of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is relieved of the debt obligations incurred prior to filing for bankruptcy. The value maps closely to the ISO code (BRUP) defined as the legal status of a company unable to pay creditors. Bankruptcy usually involves a formal court ruling. Securities may become valueless.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>BonusIssue</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a bonus issue. A bonus issue or bonus share is a free share of stock given to current shareholders in a company, based upon the number of shares that the shareholder already owns. While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the value of the company. The value maps closely to the ISO code (BONU) defined as a bonus, scrip or capitalisation issue. Security holders receive additional assets free of payment from the issuer, in proportion to their holding.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>ClassAction</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a Class Action. An action where an individual represents a group in a court claim. The judgment from the suit is for all the members of the group (class). The value maps closely to the ISO code (CLSA) defined as the situation where interested parties seek restitution for financial loss. The security holder may be offered the opportunity to join a class action proceeding and would need to respond with an instruction.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>CreditEvent</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a credit event. A credit event is any sudden and tangible (negative) change in a borrower's credit standing or decline in credit rating. A credit event brings into question the borrower's ability to repay its debt. It is the defining trigger in a credit derivative contract, or credit default swap. If the borrower experiences a credit event, then the buyer of the contract must pay the seller an agreed-upon sum to cover the loss. The value maps closely to the ISO code (CREV) defined as an occurrence of credit derivative for which the issuer of one or several underlying securities is unable to fulfill his financial obligations (as defined in terms and conditions).</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Default</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a default. The failure to promptly pay interest or principal when due. Default occurs when a debtor is unable to meet the legal obligation of debt repayment. Borrowers may default when they are unable to make the required payment or are unwilling to honor the debt. The value maps closely to the ISO code (DFLT) defined as the failure by the company to perform obligations defined as default events under the bond agreement and that have not been remedied.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>EarlyRedemption</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by an early redemption. The value maps closely to the ISO code (MCAL) defined as the redemption of an entire issue outstanding of securities, for example, bonds, preferred equity, funds, by the issuer or its agent, for example, asset manager, before final maturity.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>EquityRights</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by Equity Rights.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Liquidation</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a liquidation. When a business or firm is terminated or bankrupt, its assets are sold (liquidated) and the proceeds pay creditors. Any leftovers are distributed to shareholders. The value maps closely to the ISO code (LIQU) defined as a distribution of cash, assets or both. Debt may be paid in order of priority based on preferred claims to assets specified by the security.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Merger</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a merger. Mergers and acquisitions (abbreviated M&amp;A) is an aspect of corporate strategy, corporate finance and management dealing with the buying, selling, dividing and combining of different companies and similar entities that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its sector or location of origin, or a new field or new location, without creating a subsidiary, other child entity or using a joint venture. The distinction between a "merger" and an "acquisition" has become increasingly blurred in various respects (particularly in terms of the ultimate economic outcome), although it has not completely disappeared in all situations. The value maps closely to the ISO code (MRGR) defined as an offer made to shareholders, normally by a third party, requesting them to sell (tender) or exchange their equities.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>ReverseSplit</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a reverse split. A reverse stock split or reverse split is a process by a company of issuing to each shareholder in that company a smaller number of new shares in proportion to that shareholder's original shares that are subsequently canceled. A reverse stock split is also called a stock merge. The reduction in the number of issued shares is accompanied by a proportional increase in the share price. The value maps closely to the ISO code (SPLR) defined as a decrease in a company's number of outstanding equities without any change in the shareholder's equity or the aggregate market value at the time of the split. Equity price and nominal value are increased accordingly.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>SpinOff</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a spin Off. A spin-out, also known as a spin-off or a starburst, refers to a type of corporate action where a company "splits off" sections of itself as a separate business. The value maps closely to the ISO code (SOFF) defined as a a distribution of subsidiary stock to the shareholders of the parent company without a surrender of shares. Spin-off represents a form of divestiture usually resulting in an independent company or in an existing company. For example, demerger, distribution, unbundling.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>StockReclassification</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a Stock Reclassification.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>StockSplit</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a stock split. A stock split or stock divide increases the number of shares in a public company. The price is adjusted such that the before and after market capitalization of the company remains the same and dilutiondoes not occur. The value maps closely to the ISO code (SPLF) defined as a distribution of subsidiary stock to the shareholders of the parent company without a surrender of shares. Spin-off represents a form of divestiture usually resulting in an independent company or in an existing company. For example, demerger, distribution, unbundling.</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Takeover</SimpleValue>
            <SimpleValue>Corporate action triggered by a takeover. A takeover is the purchase of onecompany (the target) by another (the acquirer, or bidder). The value maps to the ISO code (TEND) but is finer grained than TEND which emcompasses Tender/Acquisition/Takeover/Purchase Offer/Buyback. ISO defines the TEND code as an offer made to shareholders, normally by a third party, requesting them to sell (tender) or exchange their equities.</SimpleValue>
