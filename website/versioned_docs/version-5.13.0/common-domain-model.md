title: The Common Domain Model
---

**There are seven modelling dimensions** to the CDM, which are detailed
in the following sections:

- [product-model](/docs/product-model) 
- [event-model](/docs/event-model) 
- [legal-agreements](/docs/legal-agreements)
- [process-model](/docs/process-model)
- [reference-data-model](/docs/reference-data-model) 
- [mapping](/docs/mapping)
- [namespace](/docs/namespace)


In each section, selected examples of model definitions are used as
illustrations to help explain each dimension and include, where
applicable, data samples to help demonstrate the structure.

The CDM is expressed in a language called the Rosetta DSL. All the
language components used by the CDM including types, functions and
annotations are described in the [Rosetta DSL Documentation](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-dsl/rune-modelling-component).

The complete model definition, including descriptions and other details
can be viewed in the [Textual Browser](https://portal.cdm.rosetta-technology.io/#/text-browser) in the [CDM Portal](https://portal.cdm.rosetta-technology.io).
