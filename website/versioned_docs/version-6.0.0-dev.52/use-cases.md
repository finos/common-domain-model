# Use Cases

## Introduction
The Common Data Model is a powerful framework that offers a multitude of use
cases across various industries and sectors. The standardisation that it
provides allows firms to integrate it into different systems and platforms,
promoting interoperability and data exchange across the entire market.

Documentation on some of the common use cases for the model is provided here.

## Eligible Collateral Representation

The CDM provides a standard data format to represent all the information
required to define collateral eligibility, including asset descriptors, issuer 
details, asset type, maturity profile, credit risk rating, and collateral 
haircut.

Please see [Eligible Collateral Representation](/docs/eligible-collateral-representation) for more details.

## Repurchase Agreement Representation

Repurchase transactions and lifecycle events are represented in the CDM, with 
support for basic repo transactions, fixed term repo, open repo, fixed rate and 
floating rate and buy/sell-back transactions. 

Please see [Repurchase Agreement Representation](/docs/repurchase-agreement-representation) for more details.

## Securities Lending

Securities lending products, trades and transactions are all provided by the
CDM, allowing open or term cash and non-cash collateralised loans, using 
either fixed or floating rates, on a principal or agency basis, to be 
represented. 

Please see [Securities Lending](/docs/securities-lending) for more details.

## Pre-trade Processing
Pre-trade processing refers to the various steps and procedures that market 
participants undertake before a trade is executed. The goal of this processing 
is to ensure that trades are executed efficiently and in compliance with 
regulatory requirements.

Please see [Pre-trade Processing](/docs/pre-trade-processing) for more details.
