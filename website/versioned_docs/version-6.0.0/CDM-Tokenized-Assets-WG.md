title: CDM Tokenized Assets Working Group
---

## Overview

The CDM Tokenized Assets WG aims to extend the Common Domain Model (CDM) to support tokenized assets and processes within financial products.

This initiative will begin by introducing new attributes to the current Asset and Settlement structures, allowing for specification of token standards, blockchain protocol and other token details while maintaining the integrity of the existing CDM structure. Further work - including exploration of atomic settlement and intra-day count fractions - will also be considered.  This work will be crucial in facilitating tokenised workflows for derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), and beyond.
