## Interact with the CDM community
 
## GitHub

CDM activity primarily happens in this [CDM GitHub repository](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model). [Watch](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) the repository in order to be notified of new Pull Requests and issues.
 
## Email

If you'd like to receive official updates, please send an email to help@finos.org. You can join the CDM mailing list by sending an email to [cdm+subscribe@lists.finos.org](mailto:cdm+subscribe@lists.finos.org). 
 
## Meetings

Finally, another great way to interact with the community is to attend the bi-weekly [ Contribution Review Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Contribution-Review-WG), monthly [Collateral Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Collateral-WG), monthly [FINOS  Structured Products Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Structured-Products-WG), monthly [Steering Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Steering-WG), monthly [Technology Architecture Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Technology-Architecture-WG), bi-weekly [Derivatives Working Group](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Derivatives-WG), and/or quarterly [Steering Working](https://cdm.finos.org/docs/CDM-Steering-WG) Group: email help@finos.org to be added to the meeting invites directly, or find the meeting in the [FINOS Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig%40group.calendar.google.com).
