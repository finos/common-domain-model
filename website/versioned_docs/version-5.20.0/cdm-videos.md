### [Hello CDM World! How to get started with CDM](https://youtu.be/wDzOMl8ZsgM?feature=shared)

The CDM is a model for financial products, trades in those products, and the lifecycle events of those trades. By providing a structured framework for trade events, product modeling, and lifecycle management, CDM improves efficiency, regulatory compliance, and interoperability. Developed under FINOS, it is widely adopted by major financial players like J.P. Morgan and BNP Paribas. With built-in industry mappings, composable components, and embedded logic, CDM simplifies automation and enhances data integrity. Businesses can leverage CDM to streamline operations, reduce manual effort, and improve reporting accuracy.
