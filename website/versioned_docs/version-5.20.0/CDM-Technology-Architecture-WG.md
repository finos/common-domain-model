---

## Overview

The CDM Technology Architecture [Working Group](cdm-org-structure.md) focuses on aligning the architecture, tooling services, infrastructure, development practices, and deployment of the CDM with both existing and future technologies by leveraging [Rune](https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl/blob/main/README.md). 

Please note, Rune is currently being mantained and developed by the relevant Rune Working Groups to which the Technology Architecture Working Group provides input to. 

### Responsibilities

- Defining and working on technical aspects and architecture-related items, such as language distributions, packaging, libraries, serialization, reference data architecture, and integration with other data standards.
- Collaborating closely with the [CDM Contribution Review Working Group](CDM-Contribution-Review-WG.md). 
- Meeting monthly, with the flexibility to form sub-groups as necessary to address specific technical challenges or opportunities.
